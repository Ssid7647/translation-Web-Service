Compilation of Programs : OpenMP - Compiler to Vectorize
Using command line arguments :
The compilation and execution of a program for an Intel Many Integrated Core (MIC) architecture coprocessor (-mmic) with OpenMP framework is given below.
# icc -openmp -mmic -vec-report=3 -O3 <program name> -O <Name of executable>
For example to compile a simple   openmp-matrix-matrix-multiply.c program user can type on the command line
# icc -openmp -mmic -vec -report=3 -O3 <openmp-matrix-matrix-multiply.c > -O <openmp-matrix-matrix-multiply>
The compilation and execution of a program for MIC architecture coprocessor using offload and compliation is given below.
# icc -openmp -mmic -vec-report=3 -O3 <program name> -O <Name of executable>
