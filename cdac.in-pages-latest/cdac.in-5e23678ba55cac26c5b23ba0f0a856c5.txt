December 09, 2010
The Centre for Development of Advanced Computing (C-DAC) is set to host its second meet on Cancer Biomedical Informatics Grid (caBIG) on December 9-10, 2010.
An information network enabling all constituencies in the cancer community sponsored by the National Cancer Institute (NCI), USA, caBIG's activities are supervised by the National Cancer Institute Center for Bioinformatics (NCICB).
According to Hemant Darbari, executive director, C-DAC Pune, the second caBIG meet seeks to promote the exchange of information, knowledge, and know-how towards forging a concerted effort by bringing together academic, service, and industry sectors of healthcare domain.
The event will be a meeting ground for medical researcher, practitioners, and technologists for evolving ideas, tools, training, and to create large consortia of determined individuals, groups, and organisations for finding a cure for cancer.
It will also endeavour to identify areas and gaps where action is needed and if possible, prepare grounds for presenting proposals to appropriate funding agencies in USA and India for cancer care and its eradication.
"Despite recent progress in healthcare and medical technology, we are yet to unravel the complete nature of this disease, which claims millions of victims worldwide.
The sooner we get to the root of the cancer problem, the better will we be in fighting it.
We are extremely proud to associate with researchers, scientists, medical practitioners from the caBIG community, and look forward to working collaboratively, " said Darbari.
The first meet was held in February 2009 at Pune, and later caBIG conferences took place in July 2009 and September 2010.
