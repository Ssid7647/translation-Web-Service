C-DAC e-Governance and m-Governance
C-DAC has been instrumental in supporting the (National e-Governance Plan) NeGP's vision by working on multiple levels.
We have been successful in designing and developing the messaging middleware (s) that are core components of eGovernance infrastructure.
At central level, successful deployment of National eGovernance Service Delivery Gateway (NSDG) has resulted into replication at the state level Service Delivery Gateways (SSDGs) creating a constellation of messaging gateway exchange.
The current architecture of e-Gov Exchange (i.e., the constellation of NSDG, NSD and SSDGs) complements the MSDP.
It provides seamless integration with backend departments through the existing eGov Exchange infrastructure.
A number of software solutions were developed and deployed at user organisations over the last many years.
These include
National e-Governance Service Delivery Gateway
State e-Governance Service Delivery Gateway
Mobile Services Delivery Gateway
Fulcrum, eForms Designer and Engine
SSDG - Integrated Services Implementations in States
e-Pramaan, a National e-Authentication System
Electronic Project Proposal System (e-PPS) for MeitY and ICMR
Electronic MSIPS Application System (e-MSIPS) for ESDM Standards
eRA (e-Governance Application Integration with Reconfigurable Architecture) defines a reconfigurable middleware with support for workflow and rule-based service configurations for evolving e-Governance systems
Revival facilitates a disaster recovery solution with zero recovery point objective (RPO) and negligible recovery time objective (RTO) for service delivery gateways
C-DAC has developed and deployed various e-Governance applications such as
Solutions for Department of Stamps and Registrations - Sarita, (Maharashtra), Kaveri (Karnataka) and Gauri (Goa)
Online Management, Monitoring and Accounting System (OMMAS) for Ministry of Rural Development, Government of India

Customs Valuation System (CVS) - a decision making analysis tool to assist customs officers in valuing price of a commodity.
It is implemented in Kenya, Ethiopia and India
C-DAC in m-Governance area, is developing various applications for effective governance.
Recognising the fast and deep penetration of mobile devices in the Indian geography, a mobile service delivery gateway commonly known as "Mobile Seva" is also implemented by C-DAC.
Mobile Seva has been a transforming force in the field of Electronic and Mobile based Governence.
A Mobile PKI suite is being developed to integrate with Mobile Seva for Signing and Authentication.
