Power Monitoring and Controlling Tool
P-MAC (Power Monitoring and Controlling) Tool
Brief Description
P-MAC is a unified web-based power monitoring and controlling tool for power optimization in high-performance computing (HPC).
The P-MAC is an agent-based self-managed software, which controls the power consumption of the nodes on the basis of the application context and Optimal Operating Point intelligently by DVFS (Dynamic Voltage and Frequency Scaling) knob.
The experimental results illustrate energy saving of 12 -15% by using P-MAC.
P-MAC uses CMAF (C-DAC Multi-Agent Framework) for the transmission and execution of control policies.
It reports power consumption of applications, nodes and cluster in real-time and manages power based on applicationâ€™s profile and Optimal Operating Point.
