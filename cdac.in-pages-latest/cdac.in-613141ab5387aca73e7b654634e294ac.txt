Workshop on Deep Learning Framework DeLeFa 2017
CALL FOR PARTICIPATION
Three days Workshop on
Deep Learning Framework for Applications (DeLeFa -2017)
Dates: April 5 - 7, 2017
Venue: Day -1 (April 05, 2017) at Hotel Leela Palace, Bengaluru
POSTPONED : (Day -2 & Day-3 (April 06-07, 2017) at C-DAC Knowledge Park, Bengaluru)
DeLeFa-2017 objective is to understand implementation issues of various scientific application kernels and Information Science Applications Deep Learning (DL) algorithms on emerging High Performance Computing (HPC) Systems with different Co-processors and GPU Accelerators.
An overview of Deep Learning networks which is a new set of Machine Learning (ML) algorithms and their implementation of various parallel processing Systems will be discussed.
The efforts in applications such as Speech Recognition, Face Recognition, computer vision, and Bio-Informatics will be covered.
In DeLeFa-2017, methods such as Conventional Neural Networks (CNN), Deep Belief Network (DBN) with deep architecture, Combination of Supervised, unsupervised and semi-supervised learning techniques, Hidden Markov Model (HMM), for Machine Learnings (ML) will be discussed from Application point of view.
We discuss hardware and software features of high performance computing systems (PARAM YUVA-II - Message Passing Cluster) with Co-processors (Intel Xeon Phi), GPU Accelerators (NVIDIA, AMD) and OpenPOWER Systems with Deep Learning frameworks and Libraries (Caffe, Theano, Torch, TensorFlow etc...) in DeLeFa-2017.
Various image set (ImageNet) & Training ImageNet, and learning data distribution techniques will be explored.
The three day workshop sessions will be conducted in collaboration with experts from INTEL, OpenPOWER Consortium (IBM, NVIDIA, MELLANOAX) and other experts from Academia and Research and Development Organizations.
The first day programme is collaborated with The INTEL Corporation, India and will be conducted at the Hotel Leela Palace, Bengalure.
The second programme is collaborated with OpenPOWER Consortium, involving IBM, NVIDIA and MELLEANOX Companies.
The second and third day of this programme will be conducted at C-DAC Bengaluru.
