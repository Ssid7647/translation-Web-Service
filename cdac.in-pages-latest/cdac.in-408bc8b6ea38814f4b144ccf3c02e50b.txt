EERT (Energy Efficient Rescheduling Tool)
Brief Description
EERT is an energy management tool that reschedules the scheduled high-performance computing ( HPC) applications to reduce energy consumption by maximizing the core's utilization and by switching off the unused nodes at the cluster level.
The energy savings through the consolidation of workloads on a small number of nodes depends on how the workloads are distributed on the nodes.
If there is an imbalance in the distribution of workloads on the nodes and all the core of the nodes are not executing the workloads, then the integration of the workloads can improve the efficiency of the energy.
EERT uses the "distributed multithreaded checkpointing (DMTCP)" mechanism for check-pointing, but it is transparent for checkpointing system.
The experimental results illustrate ~15% energy saving by using EERT.
