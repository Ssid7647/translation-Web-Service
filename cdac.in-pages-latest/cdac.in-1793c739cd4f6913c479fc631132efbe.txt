Prakriti Vichaya
Prakriti (constitution) is a unique concept of Ayurveda that seeks to explain the element of individuality by expressing the unique trait of an individual that is defined by the specific and permanent composition of their Dosha (primary elements) at conception.
Prakriti plays an important role in the prevention, diagnosis and treatment of diseases.
Prakriti on the physical level is 'Dosha Prakriti' and on the psychological level is 'Maanas Prakriti'.
Prakriti assessment is part of a ten-point system of evaluation of an individual and helps the physician to suggest a proper diet and lifestyle to maintain an optimum state of health.
It is also important for diagnosis and selection of drugs for specific treatment.
'Dhaatusaarataa' assessment defines the status of the Dhaatu (basic tissues).
It is interpreted as excellent (Saara) and deprived (Asaara).
Based on the assessment, a physician can isolate the probable diseases and can suggest the treatment.
