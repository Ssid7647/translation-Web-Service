Embedding language engines in Dot/Line Matrix printers
Indian languages are generally printed in graphics mode through regular Dot / Line matrix printers.
This process is very slow and a bottleneck for bulk printing applications.

This has resulted in Indian language printing at a print speed equal to that of English.
