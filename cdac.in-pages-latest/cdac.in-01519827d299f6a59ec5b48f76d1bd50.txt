Rajat Moona C-DAC director general
Indian Express - Pune Newsline
June 03, 2011
The Centre for Development of Advanced Computing (C-DAC) on Thursday announced the appointment of Rajat Moona of the Department of Computer Science and Engineering (CSE), IIT Kanpur, as its new director general.
An alumnus of IIT Kanpur, Moona had completed his PhD from the Indian Institute of Science, Bangalore and began his career as a scientific officer in IISc Bangalore before joining as a faculty member of IIT Kanpur in 1991.
Addressing the media, Moona said, "C-DAC has proven itself as a strategic partner to several national initiatives towards taking the benefits of Information and Communication Technology (ICT) to the masses.
It is today a national resource for carrying out high-end research.
As it turns 25 next year, this is possibly a good time for introspection to analyse our achievements and build upon strengths to reach even greater heights.
I strongly believe that to a large extent a collaborative approach will help us in projecting a stronger and powerful image and build our capability to meet future challenges."
The research interests of Prof Moona include embedded computing, computer security, VLSI design and operating systems.
He has played a key role in defining standards for the operating systems for smart cards for the Government of India, which are in use in applications such as driving licences, vehicle registration systems, Indian national ID and electronic passports.
