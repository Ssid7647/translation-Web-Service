IT based Computer Aided Design (CAD) Centre for Creative Design & Development by Artisans / Weavers of North Easter Region:
The objective of this project is to develop a high-end Computer Aided Design Centre for Weavers / Artisans in Carpet & Handloom Industry in the States of Assam, Arunachal Pradesh & Tripura.
C-DAC, Kolkata formulated a Methodology with proper Software Solution to address the issues for retaining work force of Weavers / Artisans community who were unable to survive stiff competition due to globalization and trade liberalization in the advanced age of Information Technology.
It came as a boon for the handloom and handicrafts of these states who were helped to enable their community to save age old traditional styles without the fear of losing the tradition or the fear of new overriding old.
Keeping in mind the literacy level of rural Weavers / Artisans, C-DAC Kolkata has developed Software Solution for Jacquard Card Punching Calculation and for taking custom graph printout of any design with fixed aspect ratio.
The software solution simplifies the whole designing process for easy deployment.
With the help of these tools and techniques, the Weavers/Artisans/SHGs are enabled to efficiently create innovative designs with higher productivity.
Developing Motif Bank is also one of the important objectives of this project.
Aim of the project is to :-
Reach out to the Craftsmen and Women who had the Skills but lacked ICT tools training to perform using PC.
Help them expertise their Innovative Sense of design and link with the ICT enabled modern tools.
Create a pool of Master Trainers so that they imbibe the same to others in the community and enhance their earning potential.
Develop a Motif Bank of Carpet & Handloom Designs.
