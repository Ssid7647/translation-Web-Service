Education and Training
With the objective of proliferating the use of Indian languages on computers, C-DAC evolved the PACE training programme in January 1996.
The PACE programme seeks to impart training in the language of the respective state.
Other than the medium of teaching, the course is structured such that, those desirous of pursuing a career in the software industry, can do so by enrolling for the advanced courses offered by the ACTS.
The PACE programme is closely monitored by C-DAC and its state level agencies, to ensure a high quality of instruction.
Emphasis is laid on close interaction with the industry, project work, and feedback mechanism from students and the industry.
