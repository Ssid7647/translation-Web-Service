Online Handwritten Character Recognition
With the advent of mobile computing various text-inputting mechanisms have been assayed but for Indian languages these still lack the simplicity and speed.
To simplify the human machine interaction GIST is working towards Online Handwritten Character Recognition.
In India, in each script there are various handwriting styles that vary according to the region, making recognition a challenging task.
GIST Lab is developing a Handwritten Recognition system with state of the art image processing and huge linguistic know-how of each Indian script.
With its expertise in embedded systems, GIST Labs is working closely to develop a highly accurate handwritten recognizer with the smallest size and fastest speed; useful for today's Handheld PDA's and mobile devices.
GIST has developed Graffiti inputting engine for mobile devices in Devanagari.
A similar work is being carried out for other Indian Languages.
