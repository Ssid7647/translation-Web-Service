HPC GPU Cluster (AMD Opeteron Processors with AMD APP GPU Devices)
Two types of Hybrid Heterogeneous HPC GPU Cluster are used in laboratory sessions of workshop.
The two clusters i.e., Intel Xeon Processor nodes as host-cpus with CUDA enabled NVIDIA GPUs as device accelerator GPUs and another cluster consists of AMD-Opteron processor nodes as host-cpu with AMD-ATI GPUs (AMDFire Stream & AMD-ATI FirePro) accelerator GPUs and AMD APUs.
These clusters can address some of the heterogeneous computing workloads.
The hybrid computing system aim is to develop system software and integrate components of the State-of-the-Art-Technology such as Stream accelerators NVIDIA GPU computing, AMD-ATI SDK.
