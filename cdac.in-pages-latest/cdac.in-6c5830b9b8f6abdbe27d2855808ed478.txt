Overview
Programs
The I/O on multi-core processors or cluster of Multi-Core processors plays an important role to understand and enhance the performance of your application.
In fact, many applications of parallel computes are memory-bound rather than CPU-bound or I/O bound.
In typical large-scale parallel and Cluster platforms, a system bus provides slots to connect I/O devices, such as disk, drives, tape drives, and network interfaces cards.
Efforts have been made in both software development and hardware design to improve the I/O bandwidth between computational units and storage systems.
Although most of these works only consider exclusive file access among the concurrent I/O requests, more scientific applications require data partitioning with overlap among the requesting processes.
In  HeMPA-2011, Multi-threaded I/O test programs are provided to understand performance issues and selective benchmarks will be discussed.

List of Programs based on I/O in multi-theaded environment :
Write a simple MPI I/O program performing sequential I/O to multiple files
Write a Pthread I/O program performing each thread writing to separate file
Write an MPI program performing MPI I/O to separate files (Using MPI 2.0)
Write an MPI program performing MPI I/O to single file (Using MPI 2.0)
Write a Pthreads I/O program reading the file with different number of threads
Write a MPI I/O program to read the file with different number of processes (Using MPI 2.0)
