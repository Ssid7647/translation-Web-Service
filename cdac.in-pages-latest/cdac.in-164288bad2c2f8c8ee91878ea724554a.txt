Modi-Script : History and Importance
Modi was invented as a cursive “shorthand” or speed writing to note down the royal edicts.
Over the centuries, Modi-script has undergone changes and can be classified as: Bahamani (16th century), Shivkalin (17th century), Peshwekalin (18th century) and Anglakalin (19th -20th century).
Traditional Devanagari was found to be excessively time-consuming since each character required as many as 3 to 5 strokes and the lifting of the hand, each time the stroke was completed.
Modi got round this obstacle by “bending” the letters thereby doing away with the need of lifting the hand.
This invention thus allowed for a continuous writing which could be used by court scribes to note the edicts.
All official documents across the Maratha empire spread across India are archived in Modi-script.
Learning Modi-Script is useful to Academician, Historian, Researcher and Legal experts and also for knowing more about cultural, heritage preservation
We aim to create awareness, increase proliferation, help in preservation of Modi-Script and generate interest in new generation of users
