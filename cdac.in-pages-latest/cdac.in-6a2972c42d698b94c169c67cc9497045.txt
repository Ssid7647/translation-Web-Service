Activities
Earthquake Engineering, Composite Materials, Smart Materials.
Earthquake simulations of large scale structures such as Buildings, Bridges, Flyovers, etc using High Performance Computing Facilities.
Development of a HPC facility for researchers, academicians and students for their computations in earthquake and geotechnical simulations of structures.
Computing Tools
OpenSees
Open System for Earthquake Engineering Simulation (OpenSees) is a software framework for simulating the seismic response of structural and geotechnical systems.
It is an open source and it has been developed as the computational platform for research in performance-based earthquake engineering at the Pacific Earthquake Engineering Research Center.
It has advanced capabilities for modelling and analyzing the nonlinear response of systems using a wide range of material models, elements, and solution algorithms.
It is designed for parallel computing to allow scalable simulations of structures on high-end computers.
