C-DAC’s Medical Informatics Standards Software Development Kit for Continuity of Care Document (CCD) Release 1 is a toolkit that provides APIs to enable integration of HL7/ASTM’s Continuity of Care Document (CCD) standard in healthcare applications.
CCD is an XML-based standard which provides a "snapshot in time" constraining a summary of the patient’s clinical, demographic, and administrative data.
The effective use of SDK ensures a move towards standardized communication methods for patient summary record exchange which brings interoperability between healthcare systems.
