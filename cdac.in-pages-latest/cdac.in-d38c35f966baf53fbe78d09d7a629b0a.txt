Other products that can be expected are `Swar, ' for the speech-impaired and `Tarang', a digital programmable hearing aid.
“The education framework includes a special educator's environment with standard assessments, individualized education plans and lesson plans, along with a multimedia-based individual learning environment.
The child just has to log in to the framework to access the personalized lessons and exercises, which are created by the educator or parent from their login environment, “ joint director of HPC-Tech, CDAC, Tarun Kohli, said.
Explaining `Swar, ' a mobile app for non-verbal children, associate director of HPC-Tech, C-DAC, Ashish Kuvelkar said the child just has to tap an image on the screen and the app will communicate it through the phone's speakers.
“ Apart from existing pictures, parents can add or delete new images, “ Kuvelkar said.
