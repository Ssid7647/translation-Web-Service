Brief Description
The 10GbE MAC core is compliant with IEEE802.3-2008 (802.3ae) specifications.
The core is designed to support different configuration modes controlled by core's register file.
The 10GbE MAC core has a data path of 64 bits.
The core has AXI-4 streaming user application interface.
The application interface is designed as a 64-bit bus operating at 156.25MHz.
The core also provides AXI-4 Lite interface to read/write configuration registers for control and configuration of the 10GbE MAC.
Main uses and domain
Packet capture, processing and playback
Network monitoring and analysis
Packet filtering, slicing, tagging and indexing
Physical layer validation of multi-lane interfaces
Network traffic generator
Layer1/Layer2 10G/40G Ethernet Tester
Network Jammer
Ethernet protocol Analyzer
