hyPACK-2013 : Mode-1 (Multi-Core Processors) Laboratory : Topics
Topics dealing with all practical and experimental aspects of various programming paradigms are considered and example programs are made available to the participants in the laboratory session.
The  hyPACK-2013 Mode-1  programme is aimed to understand the practical aspects of  performance enhancement through software multi-threading on Multi-Core Processors  focusing on thread Programming, Performance tuning aspects, System Overview of Threading, Software tools, and Memory Allocators from application point of view.
Participants will get an opportunity to  walk-through  and  execute  some of the programs designed for   Mode-1   of this workshop.
To understand scalability and performance of selective scientific and engineering or commercial applications, minor or substantive modification of the hyPACK-2013 software programs may be required.
Efforts are on to include State-of-the-Art Multi-Core Processor Systems as well as GPU based Servers in  hyPACK-2013 Laboratory in order to understand performance issues for large scale application kernels.
