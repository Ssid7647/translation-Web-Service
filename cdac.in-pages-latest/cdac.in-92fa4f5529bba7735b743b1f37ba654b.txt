Network Security
C-DAC is focusing on adaptive intrusion detection, dynamic firewall, unified threat management, and network management using behaviour based model.
This enables the detection engines to learn new attack patterns by continuously analyzing various events, such as, network traffic, host parameter etc.
Intrusion Detection & Prevention:
Intrusion Detection & Prevention is concerned with identifying intrusion into a target network or system as early as possible, and prevent such situation as much as possible.
C-DAC is focusing on adaptive Intrusion Detection using advanced concepts in artificial intelligence and data mining.
This will enable the Intrusion Detection Systems to learn new attack patterns by continuously analyzing the network traffic and deducing the behavior.
Presently, research is also being carried out to extend this approach to build Intrusion Prevention System (IPS) so that it becomes more proactive, intelligent and preventive.
