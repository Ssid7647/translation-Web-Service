Brief Description
As per Central Pollution Control Board (CPCB) of India, there are 6 criteria air pollutants and they are Sulphur dioxide (SO2), Nitrogen dioxide (NO2), Ozone (O3), Carbon monoxide (CO), PM2.5 and PM10 particulate matter.
Additional pollutants such as Ammonia (NH3) and Lead (Pb) are also listed in the National Air Quality Index document prepared by CPCB.
The level of severity of the pollutant concentrations (in ppm) are listed in the below table.
The Air Quality Monitoring Station is meant for monitoring the concentration of criteria air pollutants at various time instances of the day.
The device monitors the air pollution data and sends them to the remote server for data logging and analysis.
The device is equipped with various gas sensors like Carbon Monoxide (CO), Nitrogen dioxide (NO2), Sulphur dioxide (SO2), Ozone (O3).
Apart from the gas sensors, the device has dust particle sensors for detecting PM10 & PM2.5 size suspended particulate matters in air.
The device also has temperature, relative humidity, Barometric pressure and Ultra-Violet Index sensors for accurate measurement and analysis of pollution parameters.
The air quality data is sent to the cloud through a cellular connectivity for analytics and the data displayed in the form of Air Quality Index (AQI) in a web/mobile application.
