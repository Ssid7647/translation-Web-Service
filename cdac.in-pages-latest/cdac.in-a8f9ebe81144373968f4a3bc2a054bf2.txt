Overview
Programs
The I/O on multi-core processors or cluster of Multi-Core processors plays an important role to understand and enhance the performance of your application.
In fact, many applications of parallel computes are memory-bound rather than CPU-bound or I/O bound.
In typical large-scale parallel and Cluster platforms, a system bus provides slots to connect I/O devices, such as disk, drives, tape drives, and network interfaces cards.
Efforts have been made in both software development and hardware design to improve the I/O bandwidth between computational units and storage systems.
Although most of these works only consider exclusive file access among the concurrent I/O requests, more scientific applications require data partitioning with overlap among the requesting processes.
In  HeMPA-2011, Multi-threaded I/O test programs are provided to understand performance issues and selective benchmarks will be discussed.
