Professional Electronics, VLSI and Embedded Systems
C-DAC Noida would like to invite competent industrial partners for commercialization of the Field Programmable Gate Array (FPGA) board through transfer of technology.
The board has been developed under the project funded by Ministry of Electronics and Information Technology (MeitY).
Brief about the Institution
Centre for Development of Advanced Computing (C-DAC) is a premier R&D organization of the Ministry of Electronics and Information Technology (MeitY) mandated to carry out R&D in Information and Communication Technologies, Electronics (ICT&E) and associated areas.
Although C-DAC was established with a clear mandate of R&D in high performance computing in 1988, over the last three decades, it has diversified into several other areas of ICT to respond to the needs of the society.
With the zeal to convert its R&D outcomes into usable technologies, it is today a significant IT player with many innovative products and solutions.
In addition, C-DAC has played a key role in IT education to fulfill the higher ICT education requirements of the country's IT industry.
Brief description about the product/technology/prototype to be transferred
Key features of the "FPGA Board"
The developed platform is an easy to use low-cost FPGA development board featuring Xilinx Spartan-6 FPGA.
It is specially designed for facilitating the students and faculty to experiment with the concepts of system design using FPGAs.
The board offers a rich set of features that make it suitable for use in the following areas:
Laboratory for undergraduate courses
Variety of design projects,
Development of sophisticated digital systems.
By default the board is powered from a +5V supply from USB cable.
Built around a Xilinx Spartan-6 FPGA the board provides, a complete ready-to-use hardware suitable for hosting circuits ranging from basic logic devices to complex controllers.
A large collection of on-board I/O devices/interfaces and all required FPGA support circuits are included, so countless designs can be created without the need of any other components.
The design can be controlled and configured through PC using high speed USB interface provided on the board.
The board is designed to work with the free ISE WebPack software from Xilinx.
Main Features
The Spartan 6 LX4 is optimized for high performance logic and offers:
600 slices, each containing four LUTs and eight Flip Flops
216 Kb fast Block RAM
Two CMTs (two DCMs and one PLL)
8 DSP48A1 slices
SPI Flash ROM that stores FPGA configuration indefinitely
25 MHz oscillator frequency
USB cable for providing power and programming interface
8 LEDs, 4 Push buttons, 12 slide switches
4 digit seven segment display
8 bit VGA display
UART communication pins
30 pin expansion connectors
Key Benefits of the "FPGA Board"
Low Cost
Simple hardware
User friendly programmer
Onboard peripherals to perform digital design experiments
30 pin expansion connectors for external digital I/O interface
Students can perform various experiments ranging from combinational to sequential circuits
Instructional material with step by step programming for a set of experiments is provided online
Free access to e-learning content
