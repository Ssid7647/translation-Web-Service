Indian Language Fonts, Corpora, Dictionaries and Tools
The GIST SDK is a software development tool for Indian languages on MS Windows.
This is a set of software components that enables software developers to facilitate the use of Indian scripts with MS Windows applications.
Unlike other solutions, the significant feature of GIST SDK is that it enables the MS Windows application to process ISCII data directly.
ISCII enables alphabetic sorting, transliteration and data exchange and reusability in a uniform manner.
The GIST SDK uses ActiveX Technology from Microsoft and provides a seamless, transparent and self contained Indian language layer for data entry, storage, retrieval and printing in Indian scripts for MS Windows applications.
It is based on COM standards and can be used with any of the latest application development tools providing "OLE container" support.
GIST SDK consists of a set of Dynamic Linked Libraries (DLL's) with necessary API, a set of ActiveX controls and True Type fonts to enable integration with your MS Windows application.
Salient Features:
Develop completely self contained Indian language enabled applications rapidly and easily, using standard front-end development tools
Seamless, transparent Indian language layer
Integrated keyboard driver for typing in Indian languages with ActiveX Controls
Bi-lingual data input, storage and display.
Special bi-lingual True Type Fonts to enable intermixing of English characters with Indian script characters
Facilitates online sorting, indexing and complete editing control in 10 Indian scripts
No hardware or software based protection devices required to ship with your application
License to distribute the GIST SDK components with the Windows applications
