hypack-2013 Mode-1 : Prog. on Multi-Cores Using Java-threads
Multithreading is extremely useful in practice and it has distinct capabilities for Java application.
The Java programming language itself uses a thread to garbage collection in the background - thus saving managing of memory for complex applications.
Multithreading changed drastically in JDK 5.0, with the addition of a large number of classes and interfaces that provide high-quality implementations of the mechanisms that most application programmers will need.
The new features of JDK 5.0 and issues such as  Interrupting Threads, thread States, thread properties, synchronization, blocking queues, thread safe collections, callable and futures, executors, synchronizers, and Threads & Swing  require serious attention to understand overheads in thread programming.

Java-1.5 included following three new packages/sub-packages for concurrent programming.
java.util.concurrent :   ( Executors, Synchronizers (Semaphores, CountDownLatch, CyclicBarrier, Exchanger), Concurrent Collection (ConcurrentHashMap, CopyOnWriteArrayList, CopyonWriteArraySet), Queues (ConcurrentLinkedQueue, LinkedBlockingQueue, ArrayBlockingQueue, SynchroonousQueue, PriorityBlockingQueue)  )
java.util.concurrent.atomic :   A small toolkit of classes that support lock-free thread-safe programming on single variables.
In essence, the classes in this package extend the notion of volatile values, fields, and array elements.
java.util.concurrent.locks :   The framework permits much greater flexibility in the use of locks and conditions, Interfaces and classes providing a framework for locking and waiting for conditions that is distinct from built-in synchronization and monitors.
Example programs using Java APIs & Java Concurrent APIs, Compilation and execution of java threads programs, programs based on numerical and non-numerical computations are discussed in-order to understand Performance issues on multi-core processors.
List of Java Threads Programs :
Java APIs on Multi-Core Processor Systems :   Example programs on computation of the sum of  n  natural numbers, search the minimum integer in an un-sorted integer array, computation of Vector-Vector Multiplication using block-striped method, Computation of matrix - matrix multiplication, and implementation of Producer-Consumer model problem.
Java Concurrent APIs on Multi-Cre Processor Systems :   Examples include Writing programs for sorting an un-sorted array using Sorting algorithm, rank calculation for a large array, calculate power of  n , concurrently read and write a memory block using new  read-write lock  (new concurrency Java APIs) than old synchronization construct, concurrently read and write to a  concurrentHashMap  collection (new concurrency Java APIs) and compare performance with old Hashtable collection, concurrently read and write to a vector and  ArrayList collection  and analyze the performance,  CopyOnwriteArrayList  collection which is thread safe version of old ArrayList collection, allows concurrent updation on ArrayList while iterating.
