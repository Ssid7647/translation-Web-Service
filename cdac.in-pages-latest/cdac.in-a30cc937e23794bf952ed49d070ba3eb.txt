CES group has developed an automated workflow for real time weather simulations: “Anuman” using Weather Research and Forecast (WRF) model of National Centre of Atmospheric Research (NCAR), USA.
This tool provides high-resolution weather simulations and number of different weather forecast products useful as a decision support for various user communities.
The weather forecasting system hosted at “http://rtws.cesgroup.in” provides hourly weather outputs for 72 hours lead time.
Salient features of Anuman are:
End-to-end forecasting system
Timely generation of important weather forecast products for many applications "On-Demand"
Local-area, short-term, model based weather forecasting customized by location, application and dissemination
Current forecasts available for several different states/village areas
Capability of creating forecast products up to 4 km resolution
The location specific real time weather forecasts are useful for the decision making in terms of weather conditions over a particular area.
The WRF outputs will be used as an input for the hydrological modeling
