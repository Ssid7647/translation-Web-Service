The Param series supercomputer developed by city-based Centre for Development of Advanced Computing (C-DAC) will soon be used by nationals of Kazakhstan.
This High Performance Computing (HPC) device, known as Param Bilim, was installed by Prime Minister Narendra Modi during his visit to the country on Tuesday.
HPCs for over two decades have been the backbone of C-DAC, which has installed similar supercomputing devices in Armenia, Tanzania, Ghana, Vietnam and also supplied two systems to Russia.
"As a part of the bilateral relations shared by India and Kazakhstan, we have installed a 10 tera-flop PARAM Bilim supercomputer.
Initially, our scientists will be training the Kazakh scientists to use the high-end technology.
Later, they will initialise using the services in basic academic and research purposes, " said C-DAC Executive Director Hemant Darbari.
In future, the supercomputer could also be used in realising research in agriculture, bio-informatics, civil engineering, astrophysics, computational and molecular dynamics, understanding weather and climate dynamics among the many applications.
C-DAC develops e-sign
E-sign, popularly known as e-Hastakshar, designed and developed by C-DAC was launched during the Digital India week on July 1.
Elaborating on the latest digital signature service, C-DAC Executive Director Hemant Darbari said, “This service would enable any person to digitise his signature and use it every time there is involvement of signed documents for transactions.
C-DAC has become the Certificate Authority (CA) and it will be responsible for keeping the signatures secured, ” he said.
This service could soon be used in filing income-tax returns, issuance of passport, driving licences, Permanent Account Numbers (PAN) and also for academic purposes where documents and marksheets are needed to be submitted.
Those with Aadhar card could avail this e-sign facility as the digitised signature.
