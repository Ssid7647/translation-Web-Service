CDAC to decipher boat’s sat phone

The police on Monday sought the help of the Centre for Development of Advanced Computing (CDAC) to decipher the Thuraya satellite communication set seized from the crew of the Iranian fishing boat ‘Barooki’ detained at Vizhinjam on Sunday.
It was detained on charges of ostensible involvement in unlawful activities such as contraband transport on the high seas falling within India’s Exclusive Economic Zone (EEZ).
The Coast Guard, in the meantime, will examine the boat’s navigation plot to check if it matches the crew’s description of the course taken by the vessel since its departure from the Iranian port of Kalat on May 25.
Sources in the Navy, lead agency for Kerala’s coastal defence, said the 12 crew members maintained that the boat had an engine failure, following which it was adrift for sometime.
While the owner of the vessel was informed of their predicament, he was of little help and the catch had become rotten, they told interrogators on Tuesday.
Officials of the Mercantile Marine Department (MMD) said they were not involved in verifying the navigation plots of the ship.
The Coast Guard, whose officials remained tight-lipped, is believed to be doing the job now.
Defence spokesperson Commander Sridhar Warrier refused to comment on the development.
Uphill task
A maritime law expert, however, maintained that it would be an uphill task to prosecute the crew members, said to be Iran and Pakistan nationals, under the Convention for Suppression of Unlawful Acts Against the Safety of Maritime Navigation (popularly known as SUA) with international concurrence and under the Maritime Zones of India (MZI) Act for want of hard evidence.
