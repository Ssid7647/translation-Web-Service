SAFEDRIVE (SAFEty alert systems using Dedicated short Range communIcation for on road VEhicles)
Brief Description:
Dedicated Short Range Communications (DSRC) systems are being developed and deployed by many countries for providing vehicle-to-vehicle communication as well as vehicle to roadside communication.
As a part of the SAFEDRIVE project, On Board Unit (OBU) & Road Side Unit (RSU) hardware and Dedicated Short Range Communication (DSRC) stack are being developed for providing vehicle-to-vehicle communication as well as vehicle to roadside communication.
The products, which are developed, would enable two-way communication that can contribute to safer driving and provide various applications that use the secure vehicle-to-vehicle (V2V) communications and vehicle to roadside infrastructure (V2I) communications.
Main uses and domain
Main use:
DSRC systems can be used for a variety of applications such as vehicle-collision-warning-system, early warning system for vehicles, traffic signal priority for emergency vehicles, roadside alerts, blind curve warning, intersection collision warning, etc.
