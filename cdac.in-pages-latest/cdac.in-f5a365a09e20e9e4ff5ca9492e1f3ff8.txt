ParaDE is an Integrated Development Environment (IDE) for creating parallel applications on HPC platforms.
CAPC is an innovative software which provides a fast and effective solution for code parallelization by automatically converting a sequential C code to a corresponding parallel code suitable for the target parallel hardware.
Another App based system called MANAS, Mental health And Normalcy Augmentation System is also being earmarked sepeartely by the Principal Scientific Advisor to Govt. of India.
MANAS is a comprehensive, scalable, national digital wellbeing platform to augment mental well-being of Indian citizens and aimed to 'reach the unreached' through Digital India initiatives.
Since its inception in 1988, through a long and successful journey resulting in a plethora of scientific solutions for multifaceted challenges of the country, C-DAC is now embarking on initiatives towards the Convergence of AI and IoE (Internet of Everything).
As part of the National Supercomputing Mission (NSM), C-DAC has setup PARAM Siddhi - AI, the largest and fastest Supercomputer in India, which ranked at No. 62 position in 'TOP500 Supercomputer List - November 2020.

C-DAC products and technologies such as National Telemedicine e-Sanjeevani- the winner of Digital India Awards 2020 awarded by Hon'ble President of India, Emergency Response Support System (ERSS), Contactless Biometric Authentication System, and Adaptive Traffic Control System etc. have direct impact on the day to day lives of the citizens.
Furthermore, C-DAC has launched SAMHAR-COVID19 - Supercomputing hackathon using AI, ML, Healthcare Analytics- based Research for combating COVID-19 along with Industry & Start-ups as a pro-active response during the global pandemic.
To cater to the scientific community in an extensive manner, supercomputing facilities namely PARAM Shivay (833TF), PARAM Brahma (797TF), PARAM Shakti (1.66PF), PARAM Yukti (650TF) and PARAM Sangnak (1.3PF) are already functional at IIT Varanasi, IISER Pune, IIT Kharagpur, JNCSAR Bengaluru and IIT Kanpur respectively.
The PARAM Bio Embyro (100TF) which is deployed at C-DAC, Pune is being used for extensive research on chemical as well as ayurvedic molecule formulations against COVID 19.
On this occasion, C-DAC members pledge to continue their relentless pursuit to make India a technologically-empowered country, leading the world in equitable and ethical advancement.
The hope entrusted on C-DAC continues to be the driving force in creating innovative, inclusive and indigenous solutions towards this goal.
