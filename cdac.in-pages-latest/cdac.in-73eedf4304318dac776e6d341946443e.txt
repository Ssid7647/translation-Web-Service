Multilingual Computing & Heritage Computing
C-DAC has developed several True Type Fonts (TTFs) and Open Font Format for various Indian Languages.
For UNICODE support in various applications, C-DAC has developed Open Type Fonts for various scripts in all 22 official languages.
Over 8000 fonts consisting of True Type, Open Type and Bitmap have been produced so far.
In language computing, corpus plays a major role.
Aligned corpora provide the basis for extraction of various linguistic resources, and are useful for building translation memory, cross-language information retrieval systems, terminology extraction, etc. C-DAC has also developed dictionaries in collaboration with the Language Boards and Academies of the particular linguistic region.

The corpora text has parts of speech, annotation and the speech has phoneme level annotation.
