The Centre for Development of Advanced Computing (C-DAC), Pune has developed affordable supercomputer for educational institutes and industry for conducting high-end in-house research work.
"The supercomputer named PARAM Shavak has been developed by us having applications in scientific and engineering domains.
We have supplied PARAM Shavak to several institutions for their in-house use.
PSG College of Coimbatore and Assam Engineering College are amongst some of the users of this system, " Director General, C-DAC Prof Rajat Moona told Sakal Times.
This system provides two teraflop computing power per second.
This means that one trillion numbers can be multiplied or added in a second.
"These colleges want to train their students in supercomputing.
It is a tabletop computer, but differently configured for parallel computing and loaded with software for parallel application, " shared Prof Moona.
The supercomputer in a box solution, aims to provide capacity building with advanced technologies to perform high-end computations for scientific, engineering and academic programs to address and catalyse the research using modelling, simulation and data analysis.
According to the Director General of C-DAC, this will also help in promoting research by integrating leading-edge emerging technologies at the grass root level.
"As the scope and complexity of computational needs continue to increase at colleges and universities, professors and administrators are compelled to seek appropriate and affordable solutions.
PARAM Shavak provides the computing power necessary to keep academic institutions on the leading edge in today’s competitive market at an affordable cost, " he said.
This system is meant for research organisations and academic institutions that are on the verge of adopting High Performance Computing culture in their institutions/organisations.
"The system comes with most of the features that can be found in a full blown HPC clusters job schedulers, compilers, parallel libraries, resource managers, some of the commonly used HPC applications in engineering and scientific domains, etc, " Prof Moona said.
