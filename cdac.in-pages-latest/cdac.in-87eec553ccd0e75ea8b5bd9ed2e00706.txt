Centre for Development of Advanced Computing (C-DAC) has collaborated with the National Institute of Technology, Silchar (NITS) for establishment of a state-of-the-art high performance computing (HPC) infrastructure.
The collaboration targets computing research and analysis in the area of science.
C-DAC will deploy its indigenously developed products like C-DAC HPC Resource Management Engine (CHReME), Integrated Cluster Sytem (InCluS) and Onama.
A memorandum of understanding (MoU) was signed recently.
Nishikant V Deshpande, director of NIT, Silchar said, "We will take care of technical requirements of north-east India and provide necessary technology transfer to all colleges and institutions in this region."
Deshpande further said the HPC infrastructure will facilitate research of applications in various engineering disciplines that employ HPC technologies and related research.
The HPC system to be established at NITS will be purely dedicated to research in the field of various engineering branches.
The expertise from NITS and the computational expertise from C-DAC will foster innovative research which shall be beneficial for the society.
The collaboration will also try to address the dearth of HPC manpower in the northeast region.
"The collaboration with NITS will bring in capacity and capability building in HPC and associated areas.
Educating about the emerging technology trends shall enable the students at NITS to position themselves in cutting edge technology, " said Pradeep K Sinha, senior director of HPC, C-DAC.
