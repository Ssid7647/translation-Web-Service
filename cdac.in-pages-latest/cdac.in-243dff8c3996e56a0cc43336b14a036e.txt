Cross Language Information Retrieval
Cross Language Information Retrieval System aims to break language barrier and making domain information accessible to all users irrespective of language & region.
In this system, a user can submit a Natural Language query in a source language and s/he will be able to access documents available in the language of the query as well as the target language by using a Machine Translation System e.g. MANTRA.
The Cross Language Information Access Portal for Indian Languages project is executed by a consortium of academic, research institutions and industry partners.
In this portal a user can submit a query in one Indian language and able to access documents in the language of the query, Hindi (if the query language is not Hindi), and English.
Results are presented to the user in the language of the query.
The results can also be presented in the language in which the information originally resided.
There is also provision for translated snippet & summary in this system.
The languages involved are: Bengali, Hindi, Marathi, Punjabi, Tamil, Telugu, Assamese, Oriya and Gujarati.
