PARAM Shavak - Supercomputing Solution in a Box
Param Shavak machine PARAM Shavak - solution, aims to provide computational resource (Capacity building) with advanced technologies to perform high-end computations for scientific, engineering and academic programs to address and catalyze the research using modelling, simulation and data analysis.
This initiative is expected to create HPC aware skilled workforce (Capability building) and for promoting research by integrating leading-edge emerging technologies at grass root level.
As the scope and complexity of computational needs continue to increase at colleges universities, professors and administrators are compelled to seek appropriate and affordable solutions.
PARAM Shavak provides the computing power necessary to keep academic institutions on the leading edge in today's competitive market at affordable cost.
This system is meant for research organizations and academic institutions that are on the verge of adopting HPC culture in their institutions/organizations.
Besides a handful of value additions from C-DAC, the system comes with most of the features that can be found in a full blown HPC clusters job schedulers, compilers, parallel libraries, mpi, resource managers, some of the commonly used HPC applications in engineering scientific domains etc.

PARAM Shavak Architecture
The system consists of 2 multicore CPUs each with minimum 12 cores along with two number of accelerator cards.
The entire configuration is available in a single server in a table top model.
Regardless to the traditional HPC systems/supercomputers, this system does not require specific support infrastructure like precision air-conditioned environment, controlled humidity etc. Also, the accepted sound level is very less when compared to the traditional servers.
This brings down the infrastructure cost of the system.
