Multilingual Services from C-DAC :
Multilingual translation, localization, Subtitling & Authoring under one roof
Globalization has broken the national as well as international boundaries with inevitable need for multilingual information.
This generates huge requirement for language translation of various websites, softwares, technical manuals, advertisements, study materials etc. And to cater to this we started our Linguistic Research Centre.
Some of our services are listed below :
Multilingual development involves adapting the content along with its context.
Our aim is to provide context based translations and not just word-to-word translations.
The following example will highlight it.
The translations are also customized based on specific requirement from the customer.
Localization Services
Localization is far more than just text translation.
It is creating and adapting content for a specific grade, region, culture, or pedagogy.
It involves maintaining and managing context to be appropriately presented to a specific target audience.
To put it simply, one should feel that the content is in native language rather than one translated from English.
We at C-DAC take utmost care of this factor.
New words in native language are introduced considering the requirement of the native speakers who are invariably involved in every step of our translation/localization process.
