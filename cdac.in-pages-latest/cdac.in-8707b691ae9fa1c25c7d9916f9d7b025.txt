PARAM 10000 Premeir Institutes Project
Parallel Computing Workshop & Training at premier institute on PARAM 10000
year 2000 - 2001
Organized by:
Centre for Development of Advanced Computing Pune, Banglore
A Scientific Society of the Ministry of Communication and Information Technology, Government of India
C-DAC has undertaken a project sponsored by Ministry of Information Technology, Government of India, for popularizing the use of PARAM 10000 among Premier Academic Institutions in India for research/academic pursuits.
As a part of C-DACâ€™s efforts in this project, a 3-day Workshop and training program on Parallel Computing and Training Program on PARAM 10000 is being conducted at REC-Suratkal, BITS-Pilani, BIT-Misra, Ranchi, BHU-Varanasi, MNREC-Allhabad, Roorkee University, IIT-Kanpur, IIT-Madras, IIT-Kharagpur , IIT-Bombay IIT-Delhi , IISc-Banglore.
The workshop emphasizes on various aspects of parallel computing and includes Hands-on sessions on PARAM 10000.
By understanding the presentation material covered and the software programs provided in this workshop, scientists and engineers can develop and solve large-scale scientific applications on PARAM 10000.
Three day Workshop and training program procedings include parallel computing workshop lecture Notes and Hands-on Session on PARAM 10000 at Premier Institutes (January 2000 - September 2001) (12 Institutes which includes six Indian Institute of Technology, Indian Institute of Science-Bangalore, REC-Suratkal, BITS-Pilani, BIT-Misra, Ranchi, BHU-Varanasi, MNREC-Allhabad)
