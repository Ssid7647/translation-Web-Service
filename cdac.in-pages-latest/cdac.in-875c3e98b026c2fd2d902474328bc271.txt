Colorectal cancer is one of the leading cancers affecting both men and women.
Early stages of colon cancer occur as polyps along the inner lining of the colon surface.
This can be prevented if these colon polyps are early detected and removed.
Endoscopy is an invasive procedure used to examine surface lining of the colon, by inserting a flexible tube with a light and camera into the body, that couldn't be seen any other way.
The product ViEW, developed jointly by C-DAC and Medical College Hospital, Thiruvananthapuram, incorporates the methods for 3D reconstruction of the colon structures from CT images and provides interactive visualization and navigation through the reconstructed colon.
Main uses and domain
Provides an alternative to conventional optical colonoscopy for early detection of polyps on the colon lining
Offers non-invasive and simpler procedure
Supports automatic polyp detection and visualization
Allows visualization of the outer surface of the colon, which was not possible with conventional endoscopic methods.
Features
2D axial and thumbnail view
Multiplanar reconstruction of DICOM image slices
Manual and automatic segmentation of the colon structures
3D reconstruction and visualization of digestive tract with navigational tools
Volume rendering with 3D clipping, zoom and rotate features
Manual and automatic navigation to fly-through the internals of the colon
Record and play back function for navigation
Synchronized 3D & 2D navigation views
Automatic polyp detection and display
3D measurements of the polyps
