Brief Description
Portable Acoustic Landmine Detector (PALD) can be operated by a single person to detect and discriminate artificial objects such as landmines buried in the ground.
PALD exploits the acoustic resonance of buried objects and identifies the mine from the clutter with its unique acoustic signature.
Main uses and domain
Strategically important indigenous development which can be used in both wartime and humanitarian de-mining operations.
The Acoustic Mine Detection System (AMDS) is unique in the sense that no commercial products are available in the world market for landmine detection using Acoustic technology.
