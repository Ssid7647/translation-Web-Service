Brief Description
Industrial Control Systems (ICS) such as Supervisory Control And Data Acquisition System (SCADA), Distributed Control System (DCS) etc. are key elements of critical infrastructure of a nation.
In order to ensure the security of ICS, a fool-proof and trust worthy information technology security testing platform is necessary.
C-DAC under the sponsorship from Ministry of Electronics and Information Technology (MeitY), Govt. of India had designed and established a security test bed (ICSSTB) for assessing the vulnerabilities in various components of industrial control systems.
ICSSTB can be used for securing & protecting ICS/SCADA systems against wide range of cyber-attacks.
Various utilities can make use of this facility by testing their control system using ICSSTB.
Control systems comprising Industrial automation controllers and SCADA software can be tested using ICSSTB.
ICSSTB operates as complete sandboxed testing environment for control systems simulating field signals in real time with cyber security analysis capability.
ICSSTB developed by CDAC has the capability to define plant process model, simulate plant model and security analysis on hardware, software and communication facilities of the control system used to operate the defined plant process.
The major components of the ICSSTB are:
Plant Process Simulation Environment for simulation of plant equipments, related sensors & actuators and process for ICS under test.
ICS Security Analyser used to carry out vulnerability tests and exploits on the ICS under test.
ICS Test platform consists of facilities to install and configure control system as in a real process plant environment.
ICS test platform consists of :
Test Jig for providing mechanical support to install and configure various ICS devices like automation controllers under test
Virtualized ICS environment for ICS computers and network - sandboxed virtual machines for creating ICS networks and computers such as server, engineering workstation, operator console etc. loaded with various ICS software.
Facility for visualization of the architecture of ICS under test is possible using a Centralized viewing facility called ICS Dashboard.
