Features and Technical Specifications
Being Consortia mode project, EILMT has been designed to work with the platform and technology independent modules.
It is facilitated with the Hybrid Architecture of thin-client/thick-server design, where it uses four engines in parallel to provide best translation output.
There are various approaches like web services, http protocols and standard web browsers are available for users (clients) to communicate with the translation services of the server.
Translation Engines used here are TAG based MT (Parser and Generator) and Statistical MT (SMT).
The basic tools, such as, Input Format Extractor, Morph Analyzer & synthesizer, Named Entity Recognizer, POS Tagger, Word Sense Disambiguator, Semantic TAG Parser, Post Processing Tools, Linguistic Resource Management Tools and multilingual evaluation methodologies & Ranking Module are used.
System is facilitated with features such as -
The System is designed to use three-translation engines (EBMT, SMT & TAG) working in parallel, which facilitate the translation for all the eight language pairs.
The Collation & Ranking Module is responsible for collating translated outputs of all the 03 engines for a given language pair and rank them on the basis of translation accuracy.
Direct Data Capture Facility for device integration
System is compatible with W3C Consortium Guidelines
Browser compatibility is provided for popular browsers such as Google Chrome, Mozilla Firefox, Internet Explorer, Opera and Apple Safari.
