PCAMS-2014 Hands On Session
PCAMS-2014 Hands-on Sessions (HoS) will be conducted on Multi-Core processor Systems with GPUs and HPC GPU Cluster.
The approach adopted to parallel & heterogeneous programming for Data Intensive application kernels and numerical linear algebra on hybrid computing systems (  HPC GPU Cluster) is discussed below.
The complete programme is divided into five parts as Mode-1, Mode-2, Mode-3, Mode-4 & Mode-5
IIT Bombay CUDA Centre for excellence (CCOE)
CCOE  has setup  hybrid computing systems based on CUDA enabled NVIDIA GPU's.
The Centre has a High Performance Computing Message Passing Cluster (HPC) with CUDA enabled GPU's for Hands-On Session.
