Multilingual Computing & Heritage Computing
C-DAC has been a pioneer in the area of multilingual media and broadcast.
Porting of Indian languages onto the Video medium has enabled millions of Indians to see films sub-titled in their language of choice.
Tickers and banners on TV stations, News Channels, Cable operators, etc. use C-DAC's fonts and technologies.
LIPS Live (Language Independent Programme Subtitles on air) technology has made it possible to subtitle movies and programs in Indian languages.
Several products like MOVE CG 2001 simplify the titling of video programs with high resolution aesthetic fonts.
MultiPrompter is a solution for teleprompting in Indian languages for TV channels that are mushrooming in the Indian subcontinent.
Now MPEG-II based DVD authoring products are also available.
Electronic Programming Guides (EPGs) on DTH networks are localized with the help of C-DAC technologies.

C-DAC has already developed the IPA for Bangla language, and is currently developing IPAs for Assamese, Manipuri, Bodo, Punjabi and Marathi.
