Brief Description
Ultrasonic bottom profiler is developed as an onboard equipment for AERV (Armoured Engineers Reconnaissance Vehicle) of Indian Army.
It plots the river water depth and sediment layer thickness while crossing the river.
This plot is used by Indian Army to design the type of bridge required to cross the river.
This technology was initially developed in association with R&DE (E), Pune and currently being produced by ToT partner
Main uses and domain
This equipment works on the principle of Ultrasonic signal transmission and reception.
This uses a single ultrasonic transducer of 33KHz.
It can measure water depth up to 20 meters and layer thickness up to 150cm.
