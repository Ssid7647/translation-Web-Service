Ultrasonic Level Sensor
Brief Description
Ultrasonic Liquid Level Sensor solution for remote level monitoring applications such as underground city sewers, unattended diesel tanks at remote sites, rivers, waterways / water reservoirs, irrigation channels etc. The sensor measures and communicates periodic data from the site for long term and on-line monitoring.
The sensor also transmits immediate alerts for events such as river flood alert, sewer overflow conditions, empty or full diesel tank etc. Alerts are also available for low power supply.
The level sensor module is IP68 compatible and is made up of ABS and is suitable for using in chemically aggressive environments.
