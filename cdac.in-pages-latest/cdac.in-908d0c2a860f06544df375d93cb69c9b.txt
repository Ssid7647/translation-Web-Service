Brief Description
iCON (Industrial Controller) is a robust, scalable controller that combines the features and capabilities of a PC-based control system and is envisaged for process industries.
iCON is used in industrial settings for process control, data acquisition, remote equipment monitoring and motion control application.
iCON is primarily used to perform automation, process control and data acquisition functions such as digital and analog control, PID, motion control etc.. iCON has a modular architecture and is rack based with an embedded OS and real time functionality.
Field signals are acquired by means of separate I/O modules and are communicated to the SCADA Software (iROSE) through redundant ethernet links for monitoring and control.
Main uses and domain
Process Industries, Power Plant, Pulp & Paper, Sugar Industry, Water Treatment Plant, Food processing Industry etc.
