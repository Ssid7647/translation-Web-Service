Padma Bhushan Award
The Padma Bhushan represents the third highest civilian award in the Republic of India and is awarded to recognize distinguished service of a high order to the nation, in any field.
In the hierarchy, the Padma Bhushan comes after the Bharat Ratna and the Padma Vibhushan, but before the Padma Shri. Announced on the occasion of National Republic Day every year, it is conferred by the President of India at a function held at Rashtrapati Bhavan sometime around March/ April.
This Republic Day too saw the announcement of 104 Padma awardees in different categories, and C-DAC was elated to find the name of Dr Vijay Bhatkar for the Padma Bhushan award in the Science and Engineering category.
His name joins a select list of peerless scientists who have dedicated their lives to the cause of science and technology in the country.
