We are pleased to invite you for 2 day workshop on "Cloud Computing : OpenStack Implementation for setting up Private Cloud‚Äù on 27th and 28th Aug 2015, at C-DAC Knowledge Park, Old Madras Road, Bengaluru.
Cloud computing is a model for enabling ubiquitous, convenient, on-demand network access to a shared pool of configurable computing resources (e.g., networks, servers, storage, applications, and services) that can be rapidly provisioned.
OpenStack is a cloud operating system that controls large pools of compute, storage, and networking resources throughout a datacenter, all managed through a dashboard that gives administrators control while empowering their users to provision resources through a web interface.
Cloud Computing & OpenStack Training comprises of expert lectures and hands-on exercise to learn the concepts of Virtualization, Cloud Computing & OpenStack Cloud Middleware.
The training will help System Administrators and Cloud adopters with complete Cloud and OpenStack understanding, deployment requirements and issues.
