Nepali Boli

Keyboard:
Two types of bi-lingual keyboards are available at C-DAC, Kolkata for Indian languages-i) InScript and ii) Phonetic.
Both of these keyboards are Unicode enabled.
At present C-DAC, Kolkata has developed both InScript (Indian Script) and Phonetic keyboard for Bangla and InScript keyboard for Hindi.
Apart from Indic Script C-DAC, Kolkata has also developed IPA keyboard for typing International Phonetic Alphabet.
System features are same for all of the keyboards.
InScript (Indian Script) keyboard is the standard keyboard for Indian scripts.
InScript has common layout for all the Indian scripts.
Most Indic scripts are derived from Brahmi, therefore their alphabetic order is the same.
