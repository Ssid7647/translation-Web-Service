C-DAC Telemedicine Solutions
Owing to the shortage of doctors and hospitals in rural areas of the country, telemedicine solutions have become an attractive option to reach quality healthcare everywhere.
C-DAC has comprehensive solutions in this area, enabling patients in remote places to engage in live consultation with doctors situated elsewhere, sharing medical records and test reports online.
C-DAC telemedicine solutions have been deployed in many States in India including Odisha, Tamil Nadu, Kerala, Punjab, North East States (Sikkim and Mizoram), Himachal Pradesh and Rajasthan.
They have also been deployed abroad.
Three variations of this solution (Mercury, Sanjeevani and Dhanwanthari) are currently operational in many centres across Kerala, Tamilnadu, Odisha, Punjab, Himachal Pradesh and other countries like Tanzania and Myanmar.
C-DAC has also developed Mobile Tele-Oncology System and Mobile Tele-Ophthalmology System.
