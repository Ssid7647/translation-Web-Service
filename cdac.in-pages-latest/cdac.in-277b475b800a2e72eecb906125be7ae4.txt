Working under the thematic area of Multilingual and Heritage Computing, and for promoting IT for masses, C-DAC Mohali has been working in the direction of digitizing and preserving the traditional embroidery techniques of India.
The project is titled Bharateeya Embroidery, which will cover all the embroidery techniques and embellishments used in Indian embroidery, also providing design libraries and eLearning modules for each of these techniques.
The “Library of Designs” (Ver 1.0: for Phulkari embroidery) was released by Dr. Debashish Dutta, Scientist G, Group Head of R&D in IT Group, Department of Information Technology, Ministry of Communications and Information Technology, on the 23rd Foundation Day of C-DAC Mohali.
