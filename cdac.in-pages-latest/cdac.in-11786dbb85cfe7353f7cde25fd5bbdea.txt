It's a Web based Low - Cost, Virtual Medical Consultations between Doctors and Remote Patients located in various Medical Facilities.
This work investigates whether or not telemedicine consultations can be successfully carried out over IP based videoconferencing in client-server mode of connection with a tablet-PC based telemedicine kit.
The kit itself is based on a tablet-PC, which features a stylus that can be placed directly on the screen for additional input capabilities such as handwriting recognition.
The software would allow two-way videoconferencing with audio, input from digital medical peripherals, as well as textual input establishing the feasibility of telemedicine over multimedia conferencing requires evaluating the tradeoffs in feature set and quality of transmitted video with various limited amounts of bandwidth.
This project illustrates to what degree effective telemedicine can be carried out over videoconferencing techniques.
