40GbE 10GbE FPGA based Network Resource System
40GbE/10GbE FPGA based Network Resource System
Brief Description
Field Programmable Gate Array (FPGA) based network resource system is designed to cater to high-speed network applications pertaining to 40G/10G Ethernet/OTN.
The system features three QSFP+ and three SFP+ connectors targeting 10GbE and 40GbE data-rates respectively and high bandwidth memories such as DDR3 DRAM, RLDRAMII and QDRII+ meant for various application scenarios.
The system can provide overall network bandwidth of 170 Gbps.
The high-speed 10GbE/40GbE interfaces are directly connected to a Virtex 6 HXT FPGA, inside which the user can implement his hardware design.
This system can also be used as a development platform for designing high speed network and high performance systems.
