Using PAPI with Parallel Programs
Example 3.1
Write a parallel program to find the minimum values in Integer list using pthreads and capture the Instructions executed, Total Cycles and Load/Store Instructions for each thread using the PAPI thread PAPI support.
Description of Programs using PAPI with parallel programs
Example 3.1 :   Write a parallel program to find the minimum values in Integer list using pthreads and capture the Instructions executed, Total Cycles and Load/Store Instructions for each thread using the PAPI thread PAPI support.

Objective
Write Pthread code to Find out minimum in an un-sorted integer array and get the hardware counters data using PAPI for each thread.
The program randomly generated the list of integers.The list of integers is partitioned equally among the threads.
The size of each thread's partition of stored in a variable and the pointer to the start of each thread's partial list is passed to it as a pointer.The minimum value is protected by the mutex-lock .Threads execute the mutex lock to gain exclusive access to the minimum value.
Once this access is gained, the value is updated as required, and the lock subsequently released.
Since at any time, only one thread can hold the lock, only one thread can update the value.
As each thread does the work, an event set is created with the events PAPI_TOT_INS, PAPI_TOT_CYC, & PAPI_LST_INS and these events data for each thread are captured.
Input
Number of Threads, Size of the Integer array in terms of Class where
Class A : 10^7
Class B : 10^8
Class C : 10^9
Output
Minimum Value of the list and the execution time with the events data of each therad.
