Programmable platform for Experiments & Academic Research on SDR (PEARS)
Brief Description
Software Defined Radio (SDR) refers to a radio platform which can be programed through software (often referred to as "waveforms") to assume different personalities.
"PEARS" is a 2 channel SDR development platform which can be operated in host-assisted or stand-alone mode.
It can be configured and programmed using GNU Radio and Matlab/Simulink environments.
Main uses and domain
"PEARS" is an SDR that facilitates learning and research in modern wireless communication systems and is primarily intended for academia and research community.
It provides an ideal platform to perform practical experiments with considerable ease and enables fast-track development of new ideas and concepts into prototype implementations.
