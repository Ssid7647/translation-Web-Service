The Times of India
November 20, 2016
The country should be proactive rather than reactive in cyber security , said Union minister of state for law and justice and electronics and IT PP Chaudhary at the Centre for Advanced Computing (C-DAC) on Saturday
Chaudhary also emphasized the need to bridge the digital divide and urged various science institutions to address challenges with the help of technology .
Chaudhary was at C-DAC to inaugurate its new Advanced Computing Training School (ACTS) facility and review the institute.
The minister also launched two applications --Mobile IP App, a mobile-based application to provide intellectual property rights (IPR) services and e-Reception, a tablet based mobile reception desk.
“With the advent of technology , there has been a digital divide, which was reduced with the introduction of cheap internet and cellphones but we need to bridge this gap.
The second problem is cyber security .
Every citizen is vulnerable as hackers will leave no stone unturned to steal sensitive data.
We should aim at taking proactive steps.
Organisations like CDAC can work on such issues, “ said Chaudhary .
The minister also lamented about students' lack of interest in postdoctoral studies, which equated to fewer patents.
The Mobile IP App enables users to avail various services whenever an IPR application is filed.
The e-Reception software is designed to replace a traditional reception desk and will be helpful to organizations.
