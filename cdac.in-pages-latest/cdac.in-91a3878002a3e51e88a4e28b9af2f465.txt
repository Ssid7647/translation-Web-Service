Brief Description
EmSerV provides priority signal for Emergency Service Vehicles such as Ambulance, Fire fighting vehicles at signalized traffic junctions
Main uses and domain
Road Traffic Signaling
Features and Technical Specifications
Often the emergency service vehicles (ESV) such as Ambulances and Fire fighting crew are caught in traffic blocks at signalized junctions costing lives.
The vehicles cannot negotiate through the traffic when the traffic is stopped in Red.
The EmSerV will open all green signals in the direction of the ESV sufficiently before the emergency vehicle reach the junction.
This is achieved by establishing Vehicle to Infrastructure (V2I) communication through wireless medium and executing special signal sequence based on geofencing techniques.
