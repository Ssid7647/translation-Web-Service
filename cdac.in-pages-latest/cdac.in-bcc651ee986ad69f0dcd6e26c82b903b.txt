Agri and Environmental Electronics
Introduction
Agriculture is one of the most important sectors of Indian economy.
It is the means of livelihood of almost two-thirds of the workforce in the country.
It contributes around 25% of the GDP and employs 65% of the workforce in the country.
There are still a host of issues that need to be addressed regarding Indian agriculture and electronics and IT has a major role to play in this.
A few of these issues are -
Production enhancement
To ensure quality of food products
To assess and grade products based on quality.
Bridging the knowledge gap of farmers through online ICT services
Creating transparencies and ensuring fair play in quality and price of agricultural produces amongst the buyers and sellers through web portals and mobile services.
Being a developing country, lot of developmental work in India is under progress and in pipeline.
As a result of fast industrialization and urbanization pollution has become a real problem.
Hence the environmental issues need to be addressed with utmost importance where again Electronics and IT has a major role to play.
In order to address the above two issues, C-DAC, Kolkata has identified Agri & Environmental Electronics as one of its major frontier of advanced research, which takes convergent and holistic look at all the related areas in agricultural and environmental sectors to ensure optimum induction of IT and Electronics for improvement of productivity, quality and value.
C-DAC has already identified this thematic area, as one of its advanced research destinations and C-DAC, Kolkata is the Resource Centre for Agri-Electronics within C-DAC family.
