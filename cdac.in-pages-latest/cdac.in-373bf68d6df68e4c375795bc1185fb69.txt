A prototype Hybrid Adaptive Cluster that can be made "adaptive" to the application it is running, assigning the most effective resources in real-time as per application demands, without requiring modifications to the application.
The goal of this mixed environment is to provide total workflow optimization, which takes cares-off applications that do not parallelize well on scalar processors, can be optimized with the appropriate computation model.
The system aim is to develop system software and integrate components of the State-of-the-Art-Technology such as Reconfigurable FPGA, Stream accelerators NVIDIA GPU computing, AMD Stream computing and IBM Cell Broadband Engine Processors, and Multi-Core Processors.

Objective
Write a OpenMP-OpenCL program to compute vector vector multiplication using global memory model of OpenCL
This is an openMP implementation on host-CPU using  p  threads of OpenMP and computation on  device-GPU.
This is an implementation of vector-Vector multiplication using the block striped partitioning algorithm on  host-CPU  and  device-GPU.
Each OpenMP thread gets the block of entries of vector and each transfers the block of its vector elements to the  device-GPU from  host-CPU.
On each  device-GPU, the partial elements of the two vectors are multipled by calling the OpenCL kernel Vector-VectorMultiplication and writes the partial sclar value.
The result scalar is transfered from  device-GPU  to  host-CPU.
Output
OpenMP Master thread on  host-cpu  prints the resultant sclar value  n.
Example 1.2:
Write a OpenMP-OpenCL program to Compute the value of  pie  value by Numerical Integration using OpenMP directives and OpenCL.
( Assignment )
Objective
This is an openMP implementation on host-CPU using  p  threads of OpenMP and computation on  device-GPU using OpencL APIs One approach is to partition the data among the processes.
That is we partition the interval of integration [0,1] among the OpenMP threads, and each thread estimates local integral over its number of subinterval on GPU using OpenCL APIs.
The comptuations on GPU produced by the individual OpenMP thread are transformed back to  host-CPU .
These results are combined on  host-CPU  to produce the final result.
On  host-CPU, prints the result.
To perform this integration numerically, divide the interval from 0 to 1 into n subintervals and add up the areas of the rectangles as shown in the Figure 1 (n = 5).
Large values of n give more accurate approximations of pi .
Use MPI point-to-point communication library calls.
Figure 1 Numerical integration of  pie  function
We assume that n is total number of subintervals, p is the number of processes and p < n.
One simple way to distribute the total number of subintervals to each process is to dividen by p.
There are two kinds of mappings that balance the load.
One is a block mapping, partitions the array elements into blocks of consecutive entries and assigns the block to the processes.
The other mapping is a cyclic mapping.
It assigns the first element to the first process, the second element to the second, and so on.
If n > p, we get back to the first process, and repeat the assignment process for remaining elements.
This process is repeated until all the elements are assigned.
We have used a cyclic mapping for partition of interval [0,1] onto p processes.
Input
OpenMP master thread on  Host-CPU  prints the computed value of pi function.
Output
OpenMP master thread on  Host-CPU  prints the resultant vector
Example 1.3:

( Assignment )
Objective
Write a OpenMP-OpenCL program to Matrix vector multiplication based on CUBLAS1 library funcation calls to compute vector vector multiplication
This is an implementation of Matrix-Vector multiplication using the block striped partitioning algorithm on  host-CPU  and  device-GPU.
Each OpenMP thread gets the block of rows of the matrix and each transfers the block of its rows and vector to the  device-GPU from  host-CPU.
Then each  device-GPU multiplies the corresponding block matrix with the vector by calling the OpenCL kernel VectorVectorMultiplication (BLAS1 library call) and writes the partial product into the result vector.
The result vector is transfered from  device-GPU  to  host-CPU.
on  host-CPU to the output array.
Input
OpenMP Master thread on  host-cpu  reads the input matrix and the vector of size  n .
Output
OpenMP master thread on  Host-CPU  prints the resultant vector
