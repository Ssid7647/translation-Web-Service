Tuning & Pef. of Programs / Benchmarks on Multi-Core Processors
Tuning and Performance of Application Programs using Compiler optimization techniques, Code restructuring techniques on Multi-Core Processors is challenging.
Understanding Programming Programming Paradigms (MPI, OpenMP, Pthreads), effective use of right Compiler Optimization flags and obtaining correct results for given application is important.
Enhance performance and scalability on multiple core processors for given application with respect to increase in problem size require serious efforts.
Several Optimization techniques are discussed below.

Click here .... for list of Programs on Tuning & Performance
Example programs on numerical computations (Dense Matrix Computations) are discussed to understand Performance issues on multi-core processors.
Efforts on tuning and Performance of several programs written in MPI, OpenMP, PThreads using mathematical libraries can be made on the Multi-core Processors.
Examples programs on vector-vector multiplication, matrix-vector multiplication and matrix-matrix Multiplication algorithms on single-core & multi-core processors are considered.
