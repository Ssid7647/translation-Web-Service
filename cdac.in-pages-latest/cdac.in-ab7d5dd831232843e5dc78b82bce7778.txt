Price of crop just a call away
The Times of India

The city unit of the Centre for Development of Advanced Computing (C-DAC) will soon roll out a voice-based phone service in Bengali that will provide the price of any crop in the market at a specific location.
Also on the cards is an application for a non-evasive bulk screen of youths for diabetes based on human body emission.
Speaking on the voice-query system, C-DAC Kolkata executive director Col (retd) A K Nath explained: "You take any phone and dial a number.
You specify your location first.
Then you name the product whose market price you want to know, say 'jyoti' potato.
You'll get a voice reply with the exact price on that day."
While the technology is available in languages like Hindi, Assamese, Tamil and Telugu, the agency's Kolkata unit has developed the programme in Bengali.
"We are hoping the state government will make it a toll-free number before we launch it, " Nath added.
The agency is also experimenting with an image-capture security device.
"Recently, we completed a digitization project for a portal showcasing rare books and gramophone records of Rabindra Bhavan at Visva-Bharati.
Some of the records are in the voice of Rabindranath Tagore.
Over 3 million pages have been digitized, " said Nath.
The agency, a scientific society under the ministry of communication and IT, has modernized Raja Rammohun Roy Library Foundation by installing an automated office system.
Nabarun Bhattacharyya, the associate director, added: "Across Bengal - be it Uttarpara or Cooch Behar - we have so far digitized over 40 million pages."
Apart from these current projects, the Kolkata unit has also designed, developed and deployed advanced instruments for quality assessment of tea and rice.
