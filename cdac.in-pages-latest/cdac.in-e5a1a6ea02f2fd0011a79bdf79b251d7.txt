Summary of technical training programme :
Recognizing the evolving technology growth on multi-to-many core systems to solve Applications of C-DAC Projects, it is imperative for us to move up the value chain of technical training.
In view of exposure to these areas is an essential and urgent requirement for our CDAC projects, our Director General Prof. Rajat Moona took initiatives and discussed with us to take-up this internal technical training programme.
The HPC-FTE group seeks to enhance the knowledge quotient of C-DAC technical staff through internal training on above areas.
The objective is to ensure that C-DAC members will equip with excellent problem skills on latest “Multi-to-Many-Core technologies for their Apps” that are being used in their projects and produce outstanding IT professionals to meet the target deliverables of C-DAC IT projects.
