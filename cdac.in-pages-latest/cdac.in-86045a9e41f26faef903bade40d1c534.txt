We are pleased to invite you for the One Day Symposium on Blockchain enabled Smart Grid Market on 22 February 2019, Bengaluru.
In the world where we are dealing with internet fraud, malware and hacks, how can we trust quality and integrity of the information we get.
The answer is a block chain.
Blockchain is a decentralized database in the form of open distributed ledger for maintaining a tamper-proof record of transactional data from un-trusted participants over a distributed network.
It uses cryptography, consensus algorithms and digital signatures for commoditizing trust and provides features like security, trust, immutability, transparency, fastness, integrity etc.
