Brief Description
The TRNG tool, developed by CDAC, uses the Field Programmable Gate Arrays (FPGA) based Ring Oscillator (RO) as a source of entropy.
TRNG plays a very critical role in the field of cryptography and it could be used in many applications such as one-time password generation, cryptographic key generation and cryptographic salt generation etc.
Main uses and domain
One time password generation
Cryptographic key generation
