Brief Description
Solar energy is the most promising energy source for the future.
Grid Interactive Solar PV Power Plant of MW rating exports power generated by Solar PV Array to grid.
Major components of the system are the PV array, power converter, filter and voltage matching transformer.
The power converter is made of IGBT switches and its operation is controlled through digital controller built with advanced Digital Signal Processor (DSP).
The indigenously developed Power Conditioning Unit (PCU) is suitable for Indian grid conditions.
