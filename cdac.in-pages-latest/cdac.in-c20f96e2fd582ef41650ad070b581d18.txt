C-DAC Zigbee Stack
C-DAC Zigbee Stack
Brief Description
The CDAC ZigBee stack is implemented using TinyOS-2.x for CC2430 and CC2530 microcontroller based on the IEEE 802.15.4 and ZigBee 2007 specification.
The stack allows the Wireless network to be formed as self healing and self forming.
The MAC layer supports CSMA-CA and TDMA for channel access mechanism.
In order to upgrade the firmware in nodes even after deployment, stack supports Over the Air Programming (OTAP).
