Disaster Management
Near-Real Time Flood Monitoring in the Brahmaputra Valley using Microwave Remote Sensing
Study Area:  North Lakhimpur, Assam
Project Highlights
Mathematical transformation and thresholding-based microwave data analysis for automatic extraction of inundated areas
Developing a system for analysing microwave data to derive flood related information for the end user to operate in near-real time.
Probabilistic flood information (PROFLIN) maps for various discharge levels
Comprehensive, unified and timely data for post disaster management in the form of a Flood Response System (FRS)
Microzonation and Risk Assessment of the Landslide Affected Areas between Banderdewa - Gohpur in Itanagar Capital Complex, Arunachal Pradesh, using GIS and Remote Sensing Techniques
Study Area:  Itanagar, Arunachal Pradesh
Project Highlights
Landslide Hazard Zonation
Landslide Inventory Mapping using GPS
Generated various thematic maps and created risk assessment map using optical and microwave remote sensing data
Two critical landslide sites or landslide prone areas were identified in consultation with the Border Road Organisation for their detailed study to find out causative factors responsible for landslides
Suggested suitable mitigation measures through geotechnical parameters
Landslide Hazard Zonation Atlas of India
Project Highlights
Synthesis of landslide hazard zonation maps prepared in the various DST projects across India
Preparation of standardized landslide hazard zonation atlas for selected DST sponsored projects
