Objective
The objective of the workshop is to promote parallel computing in order to solve large scale scientific and engineering applications.
Hands on sessions will be conducted to explain practical aspects of parallel computing.
Invited lectures on real life scientific applications will give insight to the challenges.
The workshop is meant for beginners as well as advanced level users of parallel computing systems.
PARAM 10000 is C-DAC's 40 node (160 processor) 100 GF parallel supercomputer installed at the National PARAM Supercomputing facility (NPSF).
Invited lectures on Parallel computing requirements, and role of high performance computing in scientific and engineering applications will be discussed.
Introduction
The availability of various parallel computers has created a number of challenges to solve large-scale scientific, engineering and commercial applications.
For example: How should parallel computers be programmed?
How can the quality of parallel algorithms be analyzed?
How can the tools and libraries be used to extract performance?
etc. The workshop will emphasize analysis of algorithms, performance of real-life applications, invited lectures and hands-on session on PARAM 10000.
