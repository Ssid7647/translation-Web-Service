The Gemini Co-processor is fine-tuned for HPC applications over uDAPL and OpenIB software stacks.
It offloads network transport layer functionality to hardware for supporting send/receive, Remote Direct Memory Access (RDMA) and Datagram oriented communication protocols, allowing compute nodes to communicate efficiently.
Direct user level hardware access to 4096 simultaneous connection oriented and connectionless hardware endpoints (scalable upto 16K) is provided to support applications of larger problem sizes.
Gemini is capable of performing I/O from paged virtual memory with byte aligned addresses and reliable communication of maximum 4 GByte message length.
