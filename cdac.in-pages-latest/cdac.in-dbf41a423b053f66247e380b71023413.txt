Static Compensators for Mitigation of Power Quality Issues (STATCOM)
Brief Description
STATCOMs are inverter based solutions used for compensation of reactive power, harmonic currents, unbalance currents and neutral currents caused by reactive and non-linear loads.
STATCOMs are realized with current controlled PWM voltage source inverters connected to grid through interconnecting impedance.
Inverters are constructed with advanced switching devices like IGBTs.
When compared to conventional power quality solutions like switched capacitors and tuned filters, STATCOMs feature excellent dynamic performance under fluctuating load conditions, increased life, better efficiency, insensitiveness to grid frequency etc. .
Main uses and domain
Reactive power compensation to maintain grid side PF unity
Harmonic current compensation as per IEEE 519-1992 standard within the current rating of the STATCOM
Unbalance current compensation
Neutral current compensation
Domain: Power quality mitigation
