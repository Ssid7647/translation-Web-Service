The city-headquartered Centre for Development of Advanced Computing (CDAC) deployed the Param Bilim supercomputer in Kazakhstan on Tuesday to boost academics and scientific research programmes.
This is C-DAC's fifth deployment on foreign soil, Hemant Darbari, executive director of the centre announced at a news conference.
The deployment took place in the presence of Prime Minister Narendra Modi on Tuesday evening.
The system is 10 teraflop Linux-based hybrid supercomputer.
Rajat Moona, director general, C-DAC explained about the need for a supercomputer in weather and other research and scientific filed during the deployment in Kazakhstan.
Darbari said, “A demonstration of two different applications was conducted during the deployment.
One was for weather modeling that displayed weather parameters.
The second application demonstrates the molecular bonding between different molecules.“
Darbari said this facility would be useful for carrying out research and development activities in several scientific and engineering areas.
“The user can make optimum usage of the emerging technologies included in the supercomputer.
Also, applications from different fields like bioinformatics, climatology , astrophysics, computational fluid dynamics, computational chemistry , molecular dynamics, finite element analysis, agriculture among others are included, “ said Darbari.
Demonstration of applications from climatology and bioinformatics fields will be provided by C-DAC.
In the scientist exchange programme, workshops and training programmes will be conducted in India and at Kazakhstan.
