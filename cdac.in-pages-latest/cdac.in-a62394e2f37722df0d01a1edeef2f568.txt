About ICPS:
The Interdisciplinary Cyber-Physical System (ICPS) is identified as an emerging field of technology, which is expected to have significant impact on healthcare, transportation, water distribution, energy, air-soil-water quality, manufacturing and governance.
The term Cyber-Physical system (CPS), in general, refers to computer based inference, decision and control of 'physical' systems.
CPS involves large number of embedded sensors and actuators, interconnected through Internet-of-Things (IoT), with computer based analytics for the purpose of monitoring, controlling and optimizing systems like smart farms, energy grids, precision agriculture, smart cities and villages etc. It also covers the broad spectrums of Quantum Sciences, Artificial Intelligence, Robotics, Data Science, Big Data Analytics, Cyber Security etc.
CPS based technology solutions is envisaged to be the technology of present and future in order to manage the growing needs of food, utilities and services of the nation.
