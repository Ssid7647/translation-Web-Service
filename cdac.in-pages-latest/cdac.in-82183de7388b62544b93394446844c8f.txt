The core agenda of 5th eGov SecureIT 2014 was to facilitate exchange of knowledge on the subject of Cyber Security, Disaster Management, Public Safety and Security, Infrastructure Security, Border Management, Data Security; Data in Cloud, Network Security; Network Based Attacks, ICT in Policing; Traffic Modernisation, Telecom vulnerabilities; Attacks on Telecom Networks, and National Cyber Security Framework etc.
Background
India is the seventh-largest country by area, the second-most populous country with over 1.2 billion people.
With such a large geography and population, effective health care and supply chain of perishable food items chain becomes a challenge.
The criticality of safe distribution of life saving articles like blood, vaccines and drugs in a country like India, marred by huge variations in temperature cannot be overestimated.
India has around 2545 licensed blood banks with an annual blood requirement of about six million units.
However the supply hovers around 3.5 million units only.
The ever widening demand and supply gap is making the blood banks balk under choked supplies.
As per National AIDS Control Organization, the storage and transport of blood should be within a temperature controlled environment.
Permanent monitoring of blood temperature from storage to distribution and back again ensures an uncompromised level of quality.
This removes the guesswork of what might have happened to your blood outside of the blood bank.
The Indian economy is primarily based on agriculture.
More than 52 percent of India's land is cultivable, compared to the global average of 11 percent.
The transaction volume of perishable products is estimated to be around 230 million metric tons.
Although India has the potential to become one of the world's major food suppliers, the country's inefficient cold chain network results in spoilage of almost 40 percent of its total agricultural production.
About e-safeT
e-safeT is a compact, ultra-low power data logger consisting of a high resolution temperature sensor, memory, visual indicators and wireless link.
This can be used to track the thermal history of the items (Vaccine, Blood bags, Medicines, Perishable goods, and other temperature sensitive items) while in storage or in transit.
The wireless link is used for location stamping at key transit points.
e-safeT software is a smart Windows based software package that is included with every e-safeT data logger.
It allows for easy setup, retrieval, interpretation and export of the recorded data.
Simply connect your e-safeT data logger to the USB port and begin communicating immediately.
The offline analysis provides graphical representation of the temperature variation over time and Identification of zones where temperature violation took place.
Megh Sushrut an ERP Solution for Health Delivery is the first such initiative in the country by C-DAC (Centre for Development of Advanced Computing) for providing Hospital Management Information System (HMIS) using the emerging Cloud Computing and Software as a Service (SaaS) paradigm and is being implemented across the hospitals in Rajasthan State.
