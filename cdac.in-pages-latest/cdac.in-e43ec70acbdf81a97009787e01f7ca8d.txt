Tech. Prog.
Overview
Centre for Development of Advanced Computing (C-DAC) is India's national initiative in Advanced Computing set up with a mission to deliver state-of-the-art, open architecture, scalable high performance parallel computers in the desktop to teraflop range, embodying the emergent industry-standard building blocks.
Towards fulfillment of this goal, C-DAC has advented the OpenFrame Architecture which has been realized in it's celebrated PARAM series of High Performance Computers
C-DAC has established the National PARAM Supercomputing Facility (NPSF) with a view to extend the same to various industries and other institutions that need such a facility to process their diverse applications.
NPSF currently houses the PARAM 10000, having a peak computing power of 100 Giga floating point operations per second based on cluster architecture.
It has 36 compute nodes and 4 server nodes.
Each node is a quad-processor SMP based on SUN Microsystems's UltraSparc architecture, operating at 300 MHz.
C-DAC has been conducting Parallel Computing Workshops, which have attracted participation from reputed researchers from all over India.
The objective of PCOPP-2002 is to understand important issues in the performance of parallel programs for large-scale scientific and engineering applications.
PCOPP-2002 will emphasize the performance of serial and parallel programs using different parallel programming paradigms on clusters PARAM 10000.
