Brief Description
iLoC, Industrial Low power Controller is a solar powered standalone module housed in an lP65 enclosure.
The iLoC enables to monitor a remote site when it is impractical or too expensive to run electrical power to that location.
It is capable of acquiring Analog Inputs, Digital Input / Output and having programmable scan interval.
The architecture, combined with low power modes and separate switching regulators for peripherals is to achieve extended battery life especially for uninterrupted remote applications.
It is equipped with wireless communication interfaces such as ZigBee (IEEE 802.15.4), Wi-Fi (IEEE 802.11 b/g) (Wi-Fi is only for powered conditions) and configurable RS232 / RS485.
Low Power Controller embeds TinyOS operating system, which is designed for low powered devices with networking capabilities and resource constrained devices.
