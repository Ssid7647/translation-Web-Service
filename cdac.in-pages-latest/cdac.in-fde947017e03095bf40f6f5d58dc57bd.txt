Brief Description
SoUNDS is a Non Destructive Test (NDT) and Evaluation System used in space application and is configurable for testing a wide variety of products due to its high bandwidth starting from 100 Hz and customisable test parameters.
SoUNDS has been made use of for study and analysis of material properties and for detecting flaws in the material by measuring the velocity of an acoustic wave through the material and the attenuation of the wave in the Material
Main uses and domain
Over the last 10 years a series of SoUNDS products were released all of which are currently used by ISRO/DRDO for the evaluation and characterisation of materials before each launch.
This equipment now figures in the prelaunch inspection procedure of ISRO and has fully substituted Russian made NDT equipment for thermal tile evaluation.
