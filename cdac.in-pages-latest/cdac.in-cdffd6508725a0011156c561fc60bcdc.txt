OpenMP overview
1.OpenMP programs to illustrate basic API library calls
2.Programs based on Numerical Computations (Dense Matrix Computations) using thread APIs :
3. Non-Numerical Computations & I/O (Sorting, Searching, Producer-Consumer) using thread APIs :
4.
Test suite of Programs/Kernels and Benchmarks on Multi-Core Processors:
5. OpenMP 3.0
The OpenMP API is used for writing portable multi-threaded applications written in Fortran, C and C++ languages.
The OpenMP programming model plays a key role by providing an easy method for threading applications without burdening the programmer with the complications of creating, synchronizing load balancing, and destroying threads.
The OpenMP model provides a platform independent set of compiler pragmas, directives, function calls, and environment variables that explicitly instruct the compiler how and where to use the parallelism in the application.
Example programs using compiler pragmas, directives, function calls, and environment variables, Compilation and execution of OpenMP programs, programs numerical and non-numerical computations are discussed.

Description of OpenMP Programs
Example 4.1  Performance of Matrix Computation Test Kernels on Multi-Cores :
( Download source code :   In-House-OpenMP-Benchmarks.zip   )
Objective
The main objective is to execute computing Kernels on Multi-cores and evaluate the performance on Multi-Core systems for various problem sizes and threads.
This benchmark comprises of suites performing Integer / Floating-Point Numerical and Non-Numerical computations using Shared Memory Programming (OpenMP).
These suites measures the execution time of kernels of Dense Matrix Computations involving Computation of Square Matrix Norm by Row-wise/Column-wise Partitioning , Matrix and Vector Multiplication using checkerboard algorithm & Matrix and Matrix Multiplication using self scheduling algorithm ; PI computation using Numerical Integration and Monte Carlo Method ; Solving the Linear equation Ax = b using Jacobi Method ; and Sorting the given single dimension array for finding the minimum integer.
In this program OpenMP  PARALLEL directive, and CRITICAL section is used.
The CRITICAL directive specifies a region of program that must be executed by only one thread at a time.
If a thread is currently executing inside a CRITICAL region and another thread reaches that CRITICAL region and attempts to execute it, it will block until the first thread exits that CRITICAL region.
Input
The suites run for problem sizes - Class A, B, C on 1/2/4/8 threads.
Output
This Multi Core Benchmark gives the performance of system in terms of Time , Memory Utilized.
