Indoor Air Quality Monitoring Tool using Wireless Sensor Network
Indoor Air Quality Monitoring Tool using Wireless Sensor Network
Brief Description
A wireless solution for indoor air quality monitoring has been developed.
The developed solution is to measure the environmental parameters like temperature, humidity, gaseous pollutants, Particulate Matter to determine the environmental health of an indoor space.
Air Quality Index (AQI) as per EPA standard is estimated from the measured indoor criteria air pollutants.
A toolkit has been developed to view the live air quality data of deployed regions in the form of numbers and graphs.
