Professional Electronics, VLSI and Embedded Systems
Ubiquitous Computing (Ubicomp) is often referred as a new era of computing and is expected to revolutionize the way we live.
Ubicomp is also known as Pervasive Computing.
Ubicomp promises to take the internet beyond the desktop by having all the devices interconnected by network and become less visible.
The recent developments in hardware technology, wireless communication and the Internet have made Ubicomp technology development affordable in Indian context too.
Ubicomp has potential applications in several sectors such as healthcare, business processes disaster mitigation and management, farm land irrigation, and empowering the common man to improve the quality of life.
Ubicomp will create a ubiquitous environment that combines processors and sensors with network technologies (wireless and otherwise) and intelligent software.
