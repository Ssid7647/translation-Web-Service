hyPACK-2013 Mode-4 : Prog. on Computing Systems with GPGPUs
Practical approaches to write efficient programs on GPGPUs focusing on certain class of data-parallel application kernels in the area of Numerical Computations (Numerical Linear Algebra) & Solution of Partial Differential equations; and String Search Algorithms are discussed in  Mode-2  programme.
Programming approaches on Heterogeneous Computing based on OpenCL, and mixed programming on CPUs & GPUs) and an overview of High-Performance Computing (GPU) GPU Cluster will be discussed.
Industry experts may participate and discuss trends on practical programming aspects of performance issues of heterogeneous computing.
Participants will get an opportunity to  walk-through  and  execute  some of the programs designed for  Mode-1, Mode-2, Mode-3  and  Mode-4  of this workshop.
To understand scalability and performance of selective scientific and engineering or commercial applications, minor or substantive modification of the hyPack-2013 software programs may be required.
Efforts are on to include State-of-the-Art Multi-Core Processor Systems as well as GPU based Servers in  hyPACK-2013 Laboratory Sessionsin order to understand performance issues for large-scale application kernels.
Different programming paradigms on host CPU i.e. MPI, OpenMP, Pthreads and CUDA enabled NVIDIA GPUs & Heterogeneous Programming on GPGPUs (OpenCL) are integrated and several example programs for Dense/Sparse Matrix Computations are included.
