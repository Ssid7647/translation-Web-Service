hyPACK-2013 Topics of Interest : Mode-5 - HPC GPU Cluster
Mode-5 programme focus is to understand programming issues of HPC GPU cluster and develop codes using different programming on host-cpu and device GPUs.
The programming such as MPI, Pthreads and OpenMP with CUDA enabled NVIDIA GPU as well as OpenCL (AMD/NVIDIA) will be used.
The tuning and performance aspects of programs on HPC GPU Cluster will be carried out.
Topics of interest are listed below.
Mode-5 : HPC GPU Cluster : Programs based on host-cpu and devices GPUs (CUDA/OpenCL)
Simple example programs on Multi-Core Processors with NVIDIA - GPU Computing CUDA SDK will be made available.
Write Programs for performance Characteristics of host-memory, PCIe bus and network interconnect performance of HPC GPU Cluster
Programs on Matrix Computations based on MPI, Ptheads, OpenMP on host-cpu and CUDA enabled NVIDIA GPUs & OpenCL (AMD & NVIDIA) on device GPUs.
Measurements of bandwidths of PCIe Gen 2 X16 Slots of HPC GPU Cluster using CUDA /OpenCL APIs.
Low level Benchmarks measuring performance characteristics focusing on one-to-one ratio of CPU cores to GPUs of HPC GPU Cluster.
