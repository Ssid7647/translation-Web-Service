Times of India, March 16, 2010
C-DAC has developed a comprehensive system for effective monitoring of traffic in cities along with improvement of public utility services like city transport.
The area traffic control system (ATCS), under which 70 surveillance cameras and 38 traffic sensor detection kits have been installed in the city so far, will now be extended to 30 more junctions by the Pune Municipal Corporation.
The technology will be transferred to a city-based company called Nucleonics on Tuesday, but the C-DAC will continue to monitor the technical part of the system during implementation process.
The C-DAC celebrates its 23rd foundation day on Tuesday.
Ravikumar P, Joint Director, Control and Instrumentation Group, C-DAC, said, Besides Pune, the ATCS is also functional at Jaipur, Kolkata, Ahmedabad and Bangalore (on trial basis).
Developed at a cost of Rs one crore, the ATCS in Pune features speed and signal violation detection systems installed at 38 junctions, besides traffic control system and a passenger information system for 100 buses and a garbage and octroi vehicle tracking system.
The central control room is located at Swargate.
Ravikumar said, C-DAC is receiving enquiries from developing countries such as Singapore, Malaysia and Indonesia.
