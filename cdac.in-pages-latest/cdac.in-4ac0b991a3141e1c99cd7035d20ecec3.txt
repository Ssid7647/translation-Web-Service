10 Gbps Ethernet MAC IP Core
Brief Description
The 10GbE MAC core is compliant with IEEE802.3-2008 (802.3ae) specifications.
The core is designed to support different configuration modes controlled by core's register file.
The 10GbE MAC core has a data path of 64 bits.
The core has AXI-4 streaming user application interface.
The application interface is designed as a 64-bit bus operating at 156.25MHz.
The core also provides AXI-4 Lite interface to read/write configuration registers for control and configuration of the 10GbE MAC.
Main uses and domain
