Brief Description
Smart water distribution network consists of (a) Water Storage points with water level and quality sensors along with water pumps, (b) distribution lines with pressure/flow sensors and electrically actuated valves, (c) Consumer points with flow meters.
The backbone of the smart water network is the water distribution network with electrically actuated valves (butterfly valves) that controls the flow of water to the households, area-wise and street-wise.
At the pump side, the system monitors all the electrical parameters of the pump and also controls the pump speed (Variable Frequency Drive) taking the inputs from different control valves at every distribution level.
The water level sensors will be designed to monitor the availability of water in the ground level storage points.
The system identifies the leaks based on pressure information or with other simpler techniques and informs the authority the position of leak accurately so that the water gets conserved and also helps the authority to send the labour force to the right place of leak in a right time.
Water quality parameters like, pH, Turbidity and free residual chlorine are monitored and informed to the authority and also the consumers.
Other water quality parameters like, temperature, conductivity, dissolved oxygen would also be considered in the system design.
The sensors and actuators data at every place in the water network are wirelessly communicated to the central server for the authority to view and take decisions.
Figure below, shows a typical view of any city wide water distribution network.
Main uses and domain
Wireless solution for monitoring city wide water distribution network parameters
Smart city - Smart water networks
Features and Technical Specifications
Controls and monitor water distribution network from water storage points to consumers
Water meters would monitor the amount of water consumed at every household level and helps the authority to generate monthly bills - informs user about the quality of water at the source side and also at the intermediate distribution points- it also identifies, if there are any leaks in the distribution lines and informs authority quickly to take necessary actions promptly
Measurement of water pressure and level at every storage and distribution points – Inflow and outflow rate at every storage point
Modulating type valve that controls the water flow and also avoids overflow from the storage tanks
Variable Frequency Drives (VFD) to control the water pump speed based on the pressure developed in the pipeline
Wireless transmission of data collected from all the sensors and actuators – analytics performed on the data that is received in the data control center and information of the entire water distribution network would be available in the dash board for the water board authority, site engineer and the consumers
