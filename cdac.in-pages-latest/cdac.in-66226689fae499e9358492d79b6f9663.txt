An app for children’s personal safety called the Surakshith App was launched here on Thursday.The app has been collaboratively developed by Enfold, an NGO, UNICEF, CDAC Hyderabad and the Union Ministry of Electronics and Information Technology (MeitY).

The app is aimed at six to 18-year-olds and has various features such as body safety rules, tips on safe and unsafe touch, how to identify safe adults, child safety laws, internet safety and personal safety stories.
It is available in 11 different languages — Kannada, Hindi, Tamil, Telugu, Malayalam, English, Marathi, Gujarati, Punjabi, Bengali, Oriya — and can be downloaded from the Google Play Store.
