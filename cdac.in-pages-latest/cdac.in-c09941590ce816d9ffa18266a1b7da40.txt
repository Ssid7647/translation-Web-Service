ABCD-2014 : An Overview of PVM
The Parallel Virtual Machine PVM system uses the message passing model to allow programmers to exploit distributed computing across a wide variety of computer types including Massive Parallel Processors (MPPs). A key concept in PVM is that it makes a collection of computers appear as one large virtual machine.
The generic form of message passing in parallel processing is the Message Passing Interface (MPI), and PVM which are used as the medium of communication.
The PVM software provides a uni ed framework within which parallel programs can be developed in an effcient and straightforward manner using existing hardware PVM enables a collection of heterogeneous computer systems to be viewed as a single parallel virtual machine PVM transparently handles all message routing data conversion, and task scheduling across a network of incompatible computer architectures.
PVM (Parallel Virtual Machine) is a by product of an ongoing heterogeneous network computing research project involving the authors and their institutions The general goals of this project are to investigate issues in and develop solutions for heterogeneous concurrent computing PVM is an integrated set of software tools and libraries that emulates a general purpose flexible, heterogeneous concurrent computing framework on interconnected computers of varied architecture The overall objective of the PVM system is to to enable such a collection of computers to be used cooperatively for concurrent or parallel computation
Execution of PVM Programs on abcd-2014 Lab system.
step 1.  Go to the login ID named abcd2014
step 2.  Go to directory path below
/home/abcd2014/pvm3-examples/examples
stpe 3.  Use below command to compile your code.
Command :
$ gcc -g -I /usr/local/PVM3/include -DSYSVSIGNAL -DNOWAIT3 -DRSHCOMMAND=\"/usr/bin/rsh\" \
-DNEEDENDIAN -DFDSETNOTSTRUCT -DHASERRORVARS -DHASSTDLIB -DCTIMEISTIMET -DSYSERRISCONST \
-DNOTMPNAM -DSYSVSTR -DUSESTRERROR -o  ./  \    -L /usr/local/PVM3/lib/LINUX64 -lpvm3      Example     example : $ gcc -g -I /usr/local/PVM3/include -DSYSVSIGNAL -DNOWAIT3 -DRSHCOMMAND=\"/usr/bin/rsh\" \    -DNEEDENDIAN -DFDSETNOTSTRUCT -DHASERRORVARS -DHASSTDLIB -DCTIMEISTIMET -DSYSERRISCONST \    -DNOTMPNAM -DSYSVSTR -DUSESTRERROR -o hello ./hello.c \    -L /usr/local/PVM3/lib/LINUX64 -lpvm3
Step 4 :  To run pvm program folow below command.
$ ./hello
$ pvm
this will give you prompt like.
pvm> then type as below and press enter.
spawn hello for more instruction please read Readme file in same folder.
