HPC GPU Cluster : NVIDIA CUDA - Health Monitorin
The research efforts on HPC GPU Cluster are aimed to address some of the challenges with building and running GPU clusters in Parallel computing environments.
The focus is on cluster architecture, power consumption on each nodes for various work-loads, resource allocation and sharing as part of management software, health monitoring and data security, Programming models and applications.
The prototype cluster can be made "adaptive" to the application it is running, assigning the most effective resources in real-time as per application demands, without requiring modifications to the application that is written using different progrmaming is used.
GPU (OpenCL) Cluster Test Suites - Health Monitoring - Resources
GPU (OpenCL ) Application Kernels & Matrix computations - Benchmarks
Example 1.1
Write MPI - OpenCL program to perform device query operation on each GPU of a node in a HPC GPU Cluster
Example 1.2
Demonstrate health monitoring of a large homogeneous HPC GPU Cluster using OpenCL device query and check GPU memory on GPUs of HPC GPU Cluster (Assignment)
Example 1.3
Write MPI - OpenCL program to measure the host-to device bandwidth on each node with single or multiple enabled HPC GPU Cluster
Example 1.4
Write a test suite based on GPU device virtualization to execute few hundred OpenCL kernels on HPC GPU Cluster using OpenCL wrapper test (Assignment)
Example 1.5
Write MPI-Pthread-OpenCL test Program to demonstrate list of pre-/post node job allocation post-job de-allocation features in a HPC GPU Cluster environment
Example 1.6
Write MPI-Pthread-OpenCL test Program to demonstrate list of pre-/post node job allocation post-job de-allocation features in a HPC GPU Cluster environment
Application Kernels & Matrix computations - Benchmarks
