C-DAC Thiruvananthapuram has developed and implemented Mobile Telemedicine systems which are operational for many years.
These systems are vehicle based and are equipped with all necessary diagnostic equipments.
These can travel to remote areas on pre-defined schedule with medical personnel onboard for conducting medical camps.
