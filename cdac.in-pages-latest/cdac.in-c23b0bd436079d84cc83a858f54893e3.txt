National Portal and Digital Repository for Museums of India  received Special Recognition in e-Culture, Heritage & Tourism Category during Manthan Awards 2015 on 2nd December 2015.

The project is funded by the Ministry of Culture, Government of India.
The participating museums are National Museum in New Delhi; Allahabad Museum in Allahabad; Indian Museum in Kolkata; National Gallery of Modern Arts in New Delhi, Mumbai and Bengaluru; Archaeological Survey of India Museum in Goa and Nagarjunakonda; Salar Jung Museum in Hyderabad, and Victoria Memorial Hall in Kolkata.
It is a pioneering achievement, as for the first time so many museums are made accessible through single unified interface.
