Industrial Simulation Platform (iSimP)
Brief Description
With the developments in Information technology, there has been a totally new approach to the teaching, developing and experimenting with Advanced Control Algorithms for process control.
Today Process models developed in object oriented modelling languages are widely used to simulate the real processes and rigorously design and test appropriate control systems.
In today's modern plant automation and control systems, simulation Platform is an integral part of the total system.
iSimP has been developed to address these requirements with the technical know-how of Linkoping University, Sweden.
This feature is provided to learn the process behavior on line during the normal operation of the plant and improve the performance of the controllers.
An accurate simulation model allows operators to train under "live" conditions without exposing the plant to the consequences of their mistakes.
