Brief Description
The Digital India initiative is bound to accelerate the growth of born digital data by leaps and bounds.
While we know that physical records can survive for few centuries but it is difficult to guarantee the discoverability and readability of digital records beyond next ten years.
The explosion of digital information has caught most of us unprepared.
As a result the digital data created by us can be lost forever or fall victim to obsolescence and rapidly changing technologies.
Therefore, as per the objectives of Centre of Excellence for Digital Preservation funded by Ministry of Electronics and Information Technology, C-DAC, Pune has designed and developed DIGITALAYA (????????), an Electronic Records Management and Archival System.
It is extremely helpful in preserving the digital records produced in wide ranging formats.
