Endpoint (Desktop/MobilePhone) Security Solutions
"C-DAC Hyderabad has developed the following security solutions with the support of Ministry of Electronics and Information Technology (MeitY), Govt of India".
AppSamvid - Application Whitelisting Software
AppSamvid is an application whitelisting software for Microsoft Windows based operating systems.
Whitelisting allows only pre-approved files to execute on operating system.
This is in contrast to traditional signature based antivirus software approach of blacklisting the virus files.
Whitelisting has the advantage over blacklisting as it does not require frequent virus definition updates.
AppSamvid can work for Microsoft Windows XP SP2 and above operating systems.
AppSamvid can protect operating system against computer malware (such as Viruses and Trojans).

Browser JSGuard - Protects from JavaScript based threats
In the recent times, most of the systems connected to Internet are getting infected with malware and some of these systems are even becoming zombies for the attacker.
When user knowingly or unknowingly visits a malware website, his system gets infected.
Attackers do this by exploiting vulnerabilities in web browser and it is possible to acquire control over the underlying Operating System.
Once attacker compromises the user's web browsers, he can instruct the browser to visit the attacker's website by using number of redirections.
During the process, user's web browser downloads the malware without the intervention of the user.
Once the malware is downloaded, it would be placed in the file system and responds as per the instructions of the attacker.
These types of attacks mostly happen through JavaScript and malicious HTML tags.
Browser JSGuard detects and defends from such attacks made through the web browser.
It blocks access to the harmful, inappropriate and dangerous websites that may contain malicious content.
