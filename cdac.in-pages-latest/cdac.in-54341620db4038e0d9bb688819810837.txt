COPS Defender (CDAC Open Process Solution Defender)
Brief Description
COPS Defender (CDAC Open Process Solution Defender) is a protocol hardening solution intended to address the vulnerabilities in the transmission of SCADA protocols like IEC 60870-5-101 and IEC 60870-5-104 in the power systems.
This solution offers authentication at RTUs for control commands from MTU.
This provides an encrypted channel between the control center and the RTUs to prevent malicious events of man-in-middle attacks.
This is aimed to address the security concerns like data spoofing, data modification, replay attack and non-repudiation.
Main uses and domain
