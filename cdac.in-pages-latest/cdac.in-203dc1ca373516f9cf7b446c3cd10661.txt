Take a closer look at Layered Architecture of SDK.
Each layer serves a purpose defined in the standard.
Base Layer
Base layer supports all HL7 defined data types, value tables.
Base layer provides dataset level manipulation of HL7 data which is very helpful for HL7 developers.
Creation, navigation, manipulation of HL7 messages allows developers to build HL7 defined structure for communication with other HL7 compliant entities.
Data Model
Data Model supports all HL7 defined messages.
The toolkit provides object oriented approach through messages to represent HL7 data.
This mechanism is very useful for object oriented developers having little knowledge of HL7.
Data Model view of HL7 data allows developers to deal with HL7 data through object oriented wrapper classes.
HL7 Upper Layer
The toolkit provides extensive support for sending HL7 messages over the Network.
The developers can build Client and/ or Server systems using this layer.
For Example, develop a Patient Administration System that can accept and respond to messages that are related to Patient Administration System.
The Upper Layer hides complexity of the standard by providing object oriented layer on top using which developer can build various modules.
Communication Layer
This layer involves raw communication entities at the core HL7 level.
The developer can build their own application logic using toolkit.
The layer is designed taking into consideration memory and processing efficiency issues.
