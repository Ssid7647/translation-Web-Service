The research efforts on HPC GPU Cluster are aimed to address some of the challenges with building and running GPU clusters in Parallel computing environments.
The focus is on cluster architecture, power consumption on each nodes for various work-loads, resource allocation and sharing as part of management software, health monitoring and data security, Programming models and applications.
The prototype cluster can be made "adaptive" to the application it is running, assigning the most effective resources in real-time as per application demands, without requiring modifications to the application that is written using different progrmaming is used.
