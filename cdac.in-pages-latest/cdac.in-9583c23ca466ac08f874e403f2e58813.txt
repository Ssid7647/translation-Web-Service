hyPACK-2013 Hands On Session
hypack-2013 Hands-on Sessions (HoS) will be conducted on Multi-Core processor Systems with GPUs and HPC GPU Cluster for Mode-1, Mode-2, Mode-3 & Mode-4 modules.
The Day-1 programme is designed to quickly adopt to hybrid programmig on HPC GPU Cluster.
Partcipants may use basic programming APIs or fundamentals of host-cpu programming such as Pthreads, OpenMP, Intel TBB & Chamr++.
The approach adopted to heterogeneous programming for applications kernels and numerical linear algebra on hybrid computing systems (  HPC GPU Cluster) is discussed in Mode-1, Mode-2, Mode-3 & Mode-4 modules of   hypack-2013 ) are given below.
