Chief minister Prithviraj Chavan on Thursday criticised the agitating teachers in the state by saying that instead of imparting quality education they have taken to the streets to press their demands.
Chavan was speaking at the 26th foundation day of Centre for Development of Advanced Computing (C-DAC).
Project director AGNI at Advanced Systems Laboratory at Hyderabad Dr Tessy Thomas, former deputy chairman of Tata Consultancy Services FC Kohli, associate director of Indian Institute of Science, Bangalore, N Balkrishnan and C-DAC director general Rajat Moona were also present at the event.
Chavan said, “On one hand, the professors opposed to NET-SET which was minimum qualification and on the other hand they took to streets for their demands.
He pointed out that not a single university in the state was ranked among the first 100 universities in the world.”
He said it was a myth that India was IT superpower as most of the software-related work is done for foreign clients.
Chavan said that research should be relevant and directed at technology development, which would ease the life of people.
