Election Commission of India has launched a major initiative of Electoral Roll Search at National level designed and developed by C-DAC.
This service can be used by voters to search their names and get the information related to polling stations in the nation-wide (currently 16 states and UTs) electoral rolls.
The service can be accessed in any of the following methods.
Internet users can access the information by following "Voter Search" link provided on the website of the Election Commission of India (www.eci.gov.in) or thorough the website www.electoralsearch.in.
Mobile users can use SMS service by sending a pre-formatted SMS to 166 or 51969 or 9223166166.
The pre-formatted SMS must start with a word “ECI” followed by details such as name, name of father/husband, locality, age or date of birth and gender separated by commas.
As an example, an SMS "ECI Prabhat Singla" would fetch the details of a voter by name "Prabhat Singla" on a nation-wide search of voters.
Android phone based users can install an application from the Mobile Seva AppStore of the Government (apps.mgov.gov.in under electoral category).
