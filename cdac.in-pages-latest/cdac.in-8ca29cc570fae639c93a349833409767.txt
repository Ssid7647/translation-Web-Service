Advancements in digital technologies are rapidly transforming the world and in order to sustain in IT industry it is very important to upgrade the technical skills in line with latest developments along with strong programming basics.
PG Advanced Secure Software Development (PG-DASSD) course focuses on security requirements for modern software development with equal emphasis on programming foundations to make the students suitable to work in IT industry from day one.
Course gives special emphasis to the emerging technologies such as Blockchain Technology and Machine Learning and their use cases in Cyber Security.
In today's scenario, Cyber Security threats are majorly addressed reactively, but by following proper Software Security practices we can
minimize the attack surface
and address this problem proactively.
Therefore Software Security knowledge is the requirement of every Software Engineer.
Software Security aspects including Secure Software Development Life Cycle are focussed as separate modules and also relevant topics are built in every module of the course.
The course focuses on Programming Basics, Linux System Programming, Secure Network Programming, Software Security, Secure Web Application Development & Java Programming, Secure Android Programming and Emerging Technologies such as Blockchain and Machine Learning for cyber security.
Project work would focus on solving Cyber Security problem using Machine Learning and Blockchain Technologies.
