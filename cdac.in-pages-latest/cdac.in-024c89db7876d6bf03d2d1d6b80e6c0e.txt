Brief Description:
C-DAC Revival is an end to end DR solution, best suited for database intensive e-Gov and Business applications.
C-DAC Revival makes use of synchronous and semi-synchronous replication to achieve optimal business continuity with zero recovery point objective (RPO) and negligible recovery time objective (RTO).It uses iSCSI over TCP/IP to provide block replication at remote site.
It is interoperable with legacy hardware systems including SAN boxes and works very well with database based applications.
C-DAC Revival can be used to manage planned and unplanned outage, enabling 24x7 data availability.
With this business can provide long term continuity and availability, performance, productivity and customer satisfaction.
C-DAC Revival product ranges are :
● C-DAC Revival Sync: Real-time synchronous block replication over IP network from C-DAC Revival DC to C-DAC Revival DR located within 50 km to provide zero recovery point objective.
● C-DAC Revival Semi-sync : Real-time semi-synchronous block replication over IP network from C-DAC Revival DC to C-DAC Revival DR over WAN distances and provides negligible recovery point objective bounded by network delay.
● C-DAC Revival Optimal DR : Combination of synchronous and semi-synchronous block replication over IP network with three tier architecture to provide zero recovery point objective over WAN.
Main uses and domain :
e-Government application , Small and Medium Business (SMB) Applications, Data Centres
