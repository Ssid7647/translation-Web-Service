Hospital Management Information Systems (HMIS)
Hospital Management Information Systems (HMIS)
C-DAC has designed and developed a versatile Hospital Management Information System (HMIS) in various models like conventional stand-alone hospital version and SaaS (Software as a Service) over the cloud infrastructure.
The real time HMIS streamlines the treatment flow of patients and simultaneously empowers the hospital's workforce to perform their duties effectively and efficiently.
It is modeled on the unique combination of a 'patient centric and medical staff centric' paradigm, thus providing benefits to both the recipients and the providers of healthcare.
C-DAC has also developed a unique concept of state-wide implementation of HMIS across various government hospitals ranging from super specialty hospitals, medical college hospitals, district hospitals to area hospitals.
C-DAC's HMIS has been deployed in more than 40 hospitals across India.
C-DAC has developed various solutions in this area.
