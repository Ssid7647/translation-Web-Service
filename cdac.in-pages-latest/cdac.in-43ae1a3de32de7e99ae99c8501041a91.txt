Professional Electronics, VLSI and Embedded Systems
Power Electronics
Brief Description
In most buildings, including our homes, we are surrounded by devices and equipments that internally operate on DC.
Examples of these devices are PCs, LED lights, televisions, mobile phones, and other electronic appliances.
Renewable sources like PV systems, electricity is generated as DC and it is converted into AC to supply the existing systems/networks.
All these conversions are associated with power loss.
These losses can be significantly reduced by LVDC home architecture.
Advantages of LVDC home
1. Reduced AC-DC conversion stages Improved energy savings due to high efficiency of DC equipments
2. Direct interconnection with non-conventional resources like solar PV
3. Easily compatible with efficient home equipments like BLDC fans, LED lights
4. Better power quality (No power factor and harmonics related issues)
5. Safe and secure voltage level ensures human safety
