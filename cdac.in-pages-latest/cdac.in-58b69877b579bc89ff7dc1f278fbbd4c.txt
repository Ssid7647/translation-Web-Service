GSM based industrial Wireless Sensor Node (iWiSe-G)
Brief Description
iWiSe-G is a GSM based Industrial Wireless Sensor Node capable of acquiring and processing signals from any industrial sensor and transmits the information to a remote server via GPRS for monitoring and control.
The iWiSe-G collects field data, in the form of analog and digital signals, from sensors in the industrial environment and relays it to a remote server in the form of GPRS packets using its inbuilt GSM module.
The iWiSe-G is provided an ingress protection of IP65, which facilitates operation in harsh outdoor environments.
The module is solar powered with inbuilt battery backup.
