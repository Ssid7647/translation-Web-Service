PCAMS-2014 Topics of Interest
Abstract :
Programming on multi-to-many core processor Systems with Devices is an essential part of any undergraduate, post-graduate, and research education to solve large scale applications in Science & Engineering, Computational Mathematics, & Information Sciences.
FTP-2014 gives an opportunity to write, execute and demonstrate Numerical and Non-numeric Computations using different programming paradigms.
The workshop provides an opportunity to develop expertise on programming and performance aspects on parallel processing platforms on systems with devices.
