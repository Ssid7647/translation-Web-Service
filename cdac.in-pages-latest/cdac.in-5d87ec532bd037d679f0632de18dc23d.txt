The Centre for Development of Advanced Computing (C-DAC), functioning under the Union Ministry of Communications and Information Technology, and the Computer Society of India (CSI) have signed a memorandum of understanding (MoU) for taking up joint programmes on skill upgradation, training and certification.
Rajan T. Joseph, Director General of C-DAC; George Arakal, Head, Corporate HRD; P. Thrimurthy, President, CSI; and MD Agarwal, Vice-President; were present at the function, organised on the occasion of the National Execom of the CSI here on Saturday.
Mr. Joseph said the MoU would help in enhancing the outreach of C-DAC to all parts of the country.
Several joint programmes, including skill upgradation, training and certification, were being planned in a variety of domains important to the country such as Free and Open Source Software, Indian language computing, e-governance, information security, embedded systems and cloud computing.
Mr. Thrimurthy said the agreement would help upgrade the skills of the members, both professionals and students.
"There is a gap at present, especially in the smaller towns and rural areas, where there is a shortage of good training and certification services and C-DAC assistance will help us to close this gap."
Mr. Agarwal said the MoU would help the CSI to enhance ties with the industry and the research and development sector.
This association would allow it to take up joint research programmes that would help the benefits of IT to reach the common man.
Established in 1988, the C-DAC has a mandate to carry out research and development in IT, electronics and associated areas.
The CSI, the largest professional society in the IT domain, has country-wide presence, with 61 branches and 300 student branches.
It has been in the forefront of taking IT to the common man since it was established in 1965.
The agreement is expected to strengthen and consolidate the geographical research and capabilities of the two institutions.
