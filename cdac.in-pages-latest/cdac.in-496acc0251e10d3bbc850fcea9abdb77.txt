Come 2017 and the transport sector in Pune is all set to get a boost as some of the recommendations under the Smart City project will be introduced during the first pilot run.
This was informed by officials at Centre for Development of Advanced Computing (C-DAC), which is IT partner of the Pune Municipal Corporation (PMC).
Headquartered in Pune, C-DAC has been actively involved in finding IT-based solutions to various problems faced by the civic body.
The core area, however, has been identified as transport and waste management.
“We are in the final stage of sealing the Standard Operating Procedure (SOP) for the transport sector.
The team is hopeful of completing the task ahead of the December 2016 deadline, ” said Hemant Darbari, C-DAC Executive Director.
They are also reviewing several options in key sectors which are otherwise not included in the Smart City proposals for other cities.
Under the new transport regime, there will be Information and Communication Technology aided systems operational for traffic control, signal monitoring along with introduction of intelligent road management system.
“We aim to make the city smarter than what is proposed under Smart City project and currently, talks are on for the same, ” added Rajat Moona, C-DAC Director General.
Among those planned, some of them which are unique for Pune include Geographic Information System based property and land management and ICT enabled billing and recovery system for every monetary transaction.
The Ministry of Urban Development, under which the Smart City project is taking shape, will soon review the RFPs submitted by each of the 20 Smart Cities, before giving a go ahead in implementing the proposals, the officials said.
