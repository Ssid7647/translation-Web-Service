Prosthetic arm
Myo electric Prosthetic Arm
Brief Description
A low cost Myo electric Prosthetic Arm for Transradial amputees which uses surface Electro Myography (sEMG) to sense muscle movement in arm stump.
The On-board Microcontroller process the EMG signal and decide the arm movement from the Trained model (Machine learning).
The Motor control module drive the respective finger/wrist servo motors to achieve design hand movement.
Main uses and domain
Physiotherapy clinic
Human Machine Interface
Features and Technical Specifications
Two channel sEMG to achieve Six primitive hand movements.
Mechanical arm can be customized as per amputeeâ€™s requirement and can be fabricated locally using 3D printers.
Separate EMG kit is used to collect and analyze EMG data to train ML model.
Integrated with IMU (Inertial Measurement Unit) sensor is in progress for additional grasp classification.
Platform required (if any)
We are looking for Hospitals and Medical device manufacturers for collaborations.
