C-DAC Teachers’ ‘reluctant’ attitude hurts innovation: CM
Sakal Times
April 12, 2013
Chief minister Prithviraj Chavan on Thursday ticked off college teachers for their reluctance to appear for the qualifying examinations, saying this is not the attitude with which we can hope to build our future.
This is the first time that the chief minister has commented on this issue ever since the teachers went on strike, two months ago.
"Our teachers, unfortunately want to go through their career without taking the National Eligibility Test or the State Eligibility Test, demand concessions and do not want to innovate.
This kind of attitude only creates fear that we may miss the technological bus once again, as we did it in 1977, '' the chief minister said, speaking at a function organised to mark the 26th foundation day of the Centre for Development of Advanced Computing (C-DAC) at the University of Pune, on Thursday.
