"-Omics analysis" of related species based on comparing genomic features is the need of the hour, as, current high throughput genomics technologies are generating large quantities of high dimensional meta-data.
The challenge lies in capturing, modeling, integrating and analysing these data in order to provide systematic insights into complex biological systems.
Computational approaches to genome comparison have recently become a common research topic in computer science, wherein, understanding gene function, gene regulation, gene networks, phylogenetic studies and other aspects of evolution depend on accurate nucleic acid and protein sequence alignment.
To understand and analyze such plethora of humongous data, the computational biologist requires high-end specialized computing clusters which can scale applications and algorithms addressing the need of the hour for timely analysis of data with appropriate storage capacities and high-end efficient visualizers.
