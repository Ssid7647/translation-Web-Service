All Manipur Progressive Farmersâ€™ Association has organized an interaction program on an intelligent advisory system for farmers in the present scenario of agriculture in Manipur at the office of the National Identity Protection Committee ( NIPCO) building at Keishampat today.
The program was presided over by Joy Nongmaithem, President of All Manipur Progressive Farmers' Association (AMPFA) and attended by Y Ranjan, Principal Investigator of Centre for Development of Advance Computing (CDAC) as chief guest.
During the occasion Y Ranjan said CDAC is a group under the Ministry of Information and Technology, Government of India whose aim is to do research on the inconveniences faced by farmers and poor people of the country.
The reason for decrease in the outcome of agricultural products is that the state government do not provide sufficient and necessary information to farmers on agriculture, he added.
He then said that such act of government also leads to disturbance of the ecological balance of the environment.
Farmers can now have access to many useful agricultural information through mobile and internet.
Ours is a state that depends on agriculture.
The farmers are urged to do right agricultural practices so that agricultural products would increase, he said.
