KSHIPRA is a scalable communication substrate over PARAMNet-3.
Its a software environment that enables applications to communicate faster using RDMA.
KSHIPRA allows the HPC, storage and enterprise applications to take advantage of PARAMNet-3's low latency, high bandwidth capability and drastically cuts down the CPU usage, by using DAPL transport mechanism.
It also depicts PARAMNet-3 as a standard IP network.
Thus all TCP/IP applications can be run without any modifications.
MPI, SDP, IPoIB and iSER are included in the protocol set.
KSHIPRA, available as a bundled CD is a complete environment consisting of drivers, libraries, cluster management tools and documentation.
