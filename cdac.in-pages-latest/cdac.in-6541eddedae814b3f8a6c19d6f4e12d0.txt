HPC GPU Cluster (AMD-ATI Opteron Processors with AMD-ATI GPUs)
Two types of Hybrid Heterogeneous HPC GPU Cluster is used in laboratory sessions of the workshop.
The two clusters i.e., Intel Xeon Processor nodes as host-cpus with CUDA enabled NVIDIA GPUs as device GPU accelerators and another cluster consists of AMD-Opteron processor nodes as host-cpu with AMD-ATI GPUs (AMDFire Stream & AMD-ATI FirePro) as device GPU accelerators These clusters can address some of the heterogeneous computing workloads.
The implementation and programming issues of integrated cluster of Multi-Core processors with GPU accelerators, will be discussed.
The HPC GPU Cluster supports Parallel Programming models, which include Shared memory programming (POSIX Threads, OpenMP, Intel TBB), and MPI 2.0 standard on Multi Core Processors.
The Linux programming environment can be configured to match different workloads of cluster as per application demands and execute highly scalable customized applications.
