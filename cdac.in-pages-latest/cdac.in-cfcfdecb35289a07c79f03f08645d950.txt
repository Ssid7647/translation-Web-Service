hyPACK-2013 Topics of Interest : Mode-1 - Host-CPU Cores
The  Mode-1  programme covers the practical aspects of performance enhancement through software multi-threading on Multi-Core Processors focusing on Programming & Performance Tuning aspects, System Overview of Threading, Software tools, Mixed Programming, Memory Allocators, & Distributed shared Memory Programming & PGAS model from application point of view.
The Mode-1 discusses an overview of programming on host-cpu cores of HPC Cluster with coprocessors and GPU accelerators and performance of codes on numerical & non-numerical computations is discussed.
Topics of interest are listed below.
Mode-1: Tuning & Performance of programs on Multi-Core Processors & Distributed Shared Address Space (PGAS) memory Models
Example Programs based on Thread Programming constructs will be made available.
Example Programs based on Thread/OpenMP/MPI/TBB focusing on numerical computations (Numerical Linear Algebra Dense / Sparse Matrix Computations) will be discussed.
