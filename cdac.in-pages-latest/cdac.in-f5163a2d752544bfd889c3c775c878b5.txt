The Centre has a VLSI/ASIC design center, PCB-CAD facility, DSP lab, Industrial design facility, Pilot production facility and a Technology information center.
The Centre through its diversified R&D activities in the core areas, has gained multi-disciplinary in-house expertise and so could take up and successfully complete many challenging mission mode products/projects in the last few years.

Developing the electronics products and systems of today demand interdisciplinary knowledge such as Networking, DSP, Analog, Microprocessor, VLSI, Communications protocols, RF, Power and a host of other specialized fields, which are very difficult and costly to acquire and assimilate.
The centre accorded prime importance to making such products easily productionable, testable and field maintainable, thereby ensuring highly reliable operation.
The technology development initiatives are focused in the identified core areas of Electronics and Information Technology, with funding from various Sponsors.
The outputs of these efforts coupled with the high-value expertise and experience gained are conceptualized as products, either entirely new, or with quantum improvements on those based on existing technology.
Scores of technologies developed have been transferred to Technology partners for large-scale production.
