Overview:
Since the advent of the next generation sequencing technology, computational biology has undergone a paradigm shift.
The world of genomics has undergone a revolution and their effects are becoming increasingly widespread, with the exponential rise in data.
Challenges in the modern era of computational biology have shifted focus from data generation to data analysis.
Huge amounts of raw data needs to be pre-processed, assayed and integrated with existing expertise through the use of diverse sets of software tools, models and databases.
The Bioinformatics Group at Centre for Development of Advanced Computing has its core strength in analysis of such opulence of biological data, from genome assembly, annotation to downstream processing like studying functionally linked genes through phylogenetic profiling studies, phylogenetic reconstruction to study the evolutionary trends of organisms, metabolic reconstruction of prokaryotic mycobacteria in-silico, reconstruction of metabolic pathways, differential gene expression studies from microarray data, SNP studies, identification of specific biomarker genes which will lead to identification of antigenic proteins furthering their chance of being probable vaccine/drug targets.
The Bioinformatics group at C-DAC specializes in various domains of sequence analysis from genome assembly and annotation to comparative genomics study of various organisms.
Interpretation of data available from various new sequencing platforms for identification of differentially expressed genes, SNPs, indels and transcriptome studies are also carried out.
Bioinformatics group has collaborated extensively with researchers all around the globe with common research interests.
The group has successfully worked on several national and international collaborative projects like the “A systems Biology approach to annotate Mycobacterium and Salmonella genomes” with the Institute of Animal Health, Sanger Centre (UK) and Roslin Institute (Edinburgh); “Expressed Sequence Tag Analysis of Mosquito genome” and “Assembly and Annotation of Janibacter genome sequenced using ABI-SOLiD technology” with National Centre for Cell Sciences (India) to name a few.
