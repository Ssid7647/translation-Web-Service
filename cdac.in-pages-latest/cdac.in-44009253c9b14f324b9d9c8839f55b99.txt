LILA-Rajbhasha
LILA (Learn Indian Languages through Artificial intelligence) is multi-media based intelligent self-tutoring application for learning Hindi.
LILA, in Sanskrit means 'Play'.
Using LILA, learning a language on your PC can indeed be as enjoyable as playing.
Hindi Prabodh, Praveen and Pragya packages offer a user-friendly and effective tool on the World Wide Web to learn Hindi through the medium of English, Assamese, Bangla, Bodo, Gujarati, Kannada, Kashmiri, Malayalam, Manipuri, Marathi, Nepalese, Oriya, Punjabi, Tamil and Telugu.
The courses are based on the Hindi Prabodh, Hindi Praveen and Hindi Pragya syllabi, already in use for classroom teaching and distance education conducted by the Department of Official Language [DOL], Ministry of Home Affairs, Government of India.
It is a full-length 3-level course specially designed for the above mentioned official Indian Languages (Native Language) speakers of the Government and Corporate Employees and is also useful for those desirous of learning Hindi from the initial stage.
LILA HINDI PRABODH is the first in the LILA multimedia series, which was launched by the Honourable President of India on September 14, 1999 to commemorate the Golden Jubilee of Hindi as the official language of the country.
In subsequent years LILA Hindi Praveen and Pragya were also released.
LILA HINDI PRABODH is also the recipient of CSI-INFOSYS award for "Best Shrink-Wrapped Software Products".
The Salient features of the LILA packages are:
Tracer Module:
Hindi/Devanagari characters are composed of stroke types.
Many strokes make up a character, but for esthetic and practical reasons, an order for writing characters is preferred.
When writing characters, they should be contained in an imaginary box, and in proportion to other characters with which they appear.
Forethought is needed to make a character look right, beginning with where one places the character's first pen stroke, and the proportions of each stroke in relation to the rest of the character as a whole.
When one understands the principles behind the writing process, one can count the number of strokes easily.
The TRACER module enables the user to write each Hindi alphabet stroke-by-stroke.
The order of the strokes allows a writer to reproduce Hindi characters in a uniform manner.
Speech Facility:
The Speech Facility has been provided to facilitate learning of the correct pronunciation and intonation of the words and sentences.
Related words and their meanings along with images have also been provided as part of the Vocabulary Section.
To practice correct pronunciation, there is a Record and Compare facility, which allows the user to record a word or a sentence in his/her own voice and compare it with the standard pronunciation available in the packages.
Video Interface:
For easy comprehension, every lesson has a video film running alongside the narrative.
The sentence spoken in the clipping is highlighted in the text.
Thus making learning easy and interesting.
Images have also been provided for better recapitulation and understanding of concepts.
An On-Line Hindi-English / Indian language Dictionary
is available with meanings, grammatical category and pronunciation for easy reference.
This is accessible from any section of the lesson.
