The Mobile Seva is being developed around open standards, offers highly interoperable services which enables various government department to integrate with Mobile Seva platform seamlessly.
Mobile Seva platform provides a government AppStore which hosts various mobile applications developed for various government departments.
The Appstore supports hosting of applications for multiple Mobile Platforms (eg. Android, JavaME, etc.). Government Departments can develop and deploy mobile applications for providing their services through mobile devices.
Most of the android applications run on very basic phones with android and do not require high end features.
Mobile applications are listed under various categories including state wise listing for state specific services.
All the applications are currently being hosted at AppStore which can be downloaded free of cost.
The integration process is very easy and the departments need to register themselves on Mobile Seva portal and once verification is done, the departments can start using Mobile Seva services.

Citizens: Citizens can also request / apply for specific information / service through USSD services.
IVRS based services: interactive Voice Response Systems (IVRS) are the most common way for phone to communicate with a computer through the tones generated by each key on the phone keypad.

In the context of mobile governance, the IVRS application is intended to serve the C2G and G2C wings of the e-governance model.
Lots of government services (Passport, Ration card, etc.) draw a lot of enquiries from the citizens.
These enquiries are nothing but an overhead for the government and such processes, if automated through the use of IVRS, can reduce the undue overheads.
