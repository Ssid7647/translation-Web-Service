IDC helps IT professionals, business executives, and the investment communities make fact-based decisions on technology purchases and business strategy.
The IDC HPC Innovation Excellence Award recognizes noteworthy achievements by users of High Performance Computing (HPC) technologies in Scientific, Research, Academia and Government.
The program's main goals are to showcase return on investment (ROI) and scientific success stories involving HPC; to help other users better understand the benefits of adopting HPC and justify HPC investments, especially for small and medium-size businesses (SMBs); to demonstrate the value of HPC to funding bodies and stakeholders; and to expand public support for increased HPC investments.
Commenting on the achievement, an elated Dr. Hemant Darbari, Executive Director, C-DAC, Pune said, "It is our honor to receive 'The HPC Innovation Excellence Award' for the outstanding application of HPC for Business and Scientific Achievements from the stalwarts of the international HPC community.
This recognition by the IDC jury is a shot in the arm for our pioneering efforts to empower scientific research in the country.
Our goal is not just to develop new technologies but also to create an environment for the acceptability and usage of the technologies we develop.
CHReMe is an ideal tool that is paving the roadmap for HPC in the country, and truly deserves this honor."
CHReME already deployed in organizations at national and international level serves as the user friendly innovative web interface tool which allows the scientists and researchers to utilize their HPC system optimally for their research without expending their energy towards the detailed workings of HPC thus resulting in more accurate results in their respective domains.
