BRAF HPC Resources
PARAM BioBlaze is a blade based system with peak compute power of 10.65 TF.
It has 32 blade servers as compute nodes which contains total 512 computing cores of intel Xeon (sandy bridge) processor running at optimum 2.6 GHz.
This cluster has 4GB per core RAM which accumulates to 2TB RAM.
Compute nodes communicates with each other over 56 Gbps high speed FDR Infiniband interconnect.
20 TB of scratch storage is mounted on nodes using the same 56Gbps link so that the disk input/output is fast.

PARAM BioChrome Cluster is an advance blade server based HPC facility.
The cluster has a capacity of 5 TeraFlop with 504 computing cores using 6 core Intel Xeon 2.67 GHz processor.
The supercomputing environment consists of 3 Blade Chassis containing total 42 Blade servers as compute nodes.
Each blade contains two 6 core processor which accumulates to 12 cores per node and a total of 504 computing cores.
It has 2 Master nodes 2 Storage servers in High Available mode.
Total RAM available is 2016 GB.
The Storage has 20TB usable storage space configured as RAID5.
High speed QDR Infiniband with 40Gb/s speed forms the main interconnection backbone network.
Ethernet is also used as management network.
The cluster is based on RHEL 6.0 for master nodes, compute nodes and servers.
Cluster Management Utility (CMU) software from HP is used as cluster management tool.
MVAPICH2 is installed for MPI communications over Infiniband and Open PBS is used as cluster level jobmanager.

Biogene is streamlined with RCS cards having Smith-watermann algorithm for local alignment.
16 RCS cards with embedded SW are installed on 16 nodes in the cluster.
Jobs showed exponential improvement in run time.
Results
A test run for aligning "Titin" sequence from mouse against "nr" database was done which gave the following results with reference to the time required to complete the alignment.
Puntime of 6days 2hrs 45min using the serial version of SW is reduced to 6hrs 13min using single RCS card saving 95.75% runtime.
Using 16 cards runtime is reduced to 33min saving 99.62% runtime with respect to the serial version of SW without RCS.
