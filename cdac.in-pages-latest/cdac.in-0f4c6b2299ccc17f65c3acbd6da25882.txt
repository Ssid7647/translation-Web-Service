C-DAC has been instrumental in supporting the (National e-Governance Plan) NeGP's vision by working on multiple levels.
We have been successful in designing and developing the messaging middleware (s) that are core components of eGovernance infrastructure.
At central level, successful deployment of National eGovernance Service Delivery Gateway (NSDG) has resulted into replication at the state level Service Delivery Gateways (SSDGs) creating a constellation of messaging gateway exchange.
The current architecture of e-Gov Exchange (i.e., the constellation of NSDG, NSD and SSDGs) complements the MSDP.
It provides seamless integration with backend departments through the existing eGov Exchange infrastructure.
A number of software solutions were developed and deployed at user organisations over the last many years.
These include
National e-Governance Service Delivery Gateway
State e-Governance Service Delivery Gateway
Mobile Services Delivery Gateway
Fulcrum, eForms Designer and Engine
SSDG - Integrated Services Implementations in States
