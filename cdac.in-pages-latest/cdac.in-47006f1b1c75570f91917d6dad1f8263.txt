Therefore, as per the content archival policy adopted by this department, contents will be deleted from the site after its expiry date.
Important data will be shifted to the archives page.
Therefore, the content contributors should revalidate/modify the content periodically to ensure that expired data is not present/flashed in the site.
Wherever contents are no longer needed to be displayed, suitable advice may be sent to the web information manager for their archival/deletion.
Each of the content components is accompanied by meta data, source and validity date.
