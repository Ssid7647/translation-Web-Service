Overview
Getting Started : GPU Cluster : OpenMP - CUDA - Matrix Computations
GPU Cluster : Pthreads - CUDA Dense Matrix Computations
MPI - CUDA - Dense Matrix Compuations - Application Kernels
GPU Cluster Health Monitoring - Low level Benchmarks
Two tyes of Hybrid Heterogneous HPC GPU Cluster is used in laboratory sessions of workshop.
The two clusters i.e., Intel Xeon Processor nodes as host-cpus with CUDA enabled NVIDIA GPUs as device accelerator GPUs and another cluster consists of AMD-Opteron processor nodes as host-cpu with AMD-ATI GPUs (AMDFire Stream & AMD-ATI FirePro) accelerator GPUs.
These clusters can address some of the heterogeneous computing workloads.
These sytems can be made "adaptive" to the application it is running, assigning the most effective resources in real-time as per application demands, without requiring modifications to the application.
The hybrid computing system aim is to develop system software and integrate components of the State-of-the-Art-Technology such as Stream accelerators NVIDIA GPU computing, AMD-ATI SDK.

The implementation and programming issues of integrated cluster of Multi-Core processors with GPU accelerators, will be discussed.
The HPC GPU Cluster supports Parallel Programming models, which include Shared memory programming (POSIX Threads, OpenMP, Intel TBB), and MPI 2.0 standard on Multi Core Processors.
The Linux programming environment is provided on Cluster and the operating environment can be designed to run large complex application that can make use of GPGPU / GPU computing accelerators attached to Multi-Core Processors in an efficient way.
