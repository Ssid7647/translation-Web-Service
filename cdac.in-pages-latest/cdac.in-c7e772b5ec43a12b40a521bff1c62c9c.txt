Civil Engineering Management Information System (CEMIS) - Northern Railways
CEMIS is a Three-Tier Distributed Decision Support System.
This Application is a combination of Decision Support System and Management Information System.
Decision Support Systems (DSS) assists managers who must take decisions that are not highly structured in nature.
It determines the information needed and provides information to managers who must make judgments about particular situations.
Management Information Systems (MIS) assists managers in decision-making and problem solving.
MIS system provides inputs to be used in the managerial decision making process.
MIS deals with supporting well-structured decision situations.
Data and information will be preserved in the database server for a due course of time.
These preserved data will be useful at the time of decision-making.
In other word, CEMIS partially comes under the data warehousing application system.
The application will not only help the higher management at decision making time but as well as the lower level in their day-to-day activities also.
Achievements:
This Project is successfully implemented at Baroda House (HQ of NR) & all Divisions of Indian Railways.
