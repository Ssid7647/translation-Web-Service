GistOra Tools
(Server side database application development tool for the development and implementation of Indian Language enabled applications)
Salient features:
GISTOraTools is a Server side database application development tool for the development and implementation of Indian Language enabled applications.
GISTOraTools works from within the ORACLE environment and encourages speedy Indian Language application development using ORACLE.
GISTOraTools resides on the server database and enables data conversions (this also includes various Indian languages converted to and from English in some flavors of GISTOraTools).
GISTOraTools can be used with any front-end for desktop / LAN (VB, D2K) as well as web applications (Forms-9i).
This is a generic solution for applications, which require data conversion prior to storing into, as well as retrieving from the database.
The functionality and processing required for supporting various languages of India is encapsulated within the database thereby abstracting the processing and Indian language computing know-how from the average developer.
This saves the time and the cost of training your developers in Indian language Computing Fundamentals.
GISTOraTools is an ideal companion for other applications created by using the other application development tools by GIST for Indian languages such as.
