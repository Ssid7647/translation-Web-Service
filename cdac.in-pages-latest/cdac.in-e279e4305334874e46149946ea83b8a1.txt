Compilation of Programs : OpenMP - Compiler to Vectorize
Using command line arguments :
The compilation and execution of a program for an Intel Many Integrated Core (MIC) architecture coprocessor (-mmic) with OpenMP framework is given below.
# icc -openmp -mmic -vec-report=3 -O3 <program name> -O <Name of executable>
For example to compile a simple   openmp-matrix-matrix-multiply.c program user can type on the command line
# icc -openmp -mmic -vec -report=3 -O3 <openmp-matrix-matrix-multiply.c > -O <openmp-matrix-matrix-multiply>
The compilation and execution of a program for MIC architecture coprocessor using offload and compliation is given below.
# icc -openmp -mmic -vec-report=3 -O3 <program name> -O <Name of executable>

Objective
To solve matrix multiplication on multiple mics using pthreads
Description
In this n no of threads are generated based on no of mic devices available.Equal amount of work is divided between available devices and matrix multiplication is performed on mic devices.
Input
Matrix size.
Output
Time elapsed and GFLOPS.
