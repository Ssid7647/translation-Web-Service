The HPCC software suite of products includes high performance compilers, parallel debuggers, data visualisers and performance profilers.
High performance communication protocols and efficient MPI implementation provide the correct framework to extract maximum performance.
The HPCC software consists of
Base software that includes a lightweight communication substrate, optimized MPI, and a parallel file system with MPI-IO interface
A Program Development environment, providing a rich set of FORTRAN 77 / Fortran 90 program development tools, and an integrated debugging environment for parallel programs
System Management tools for monitoring the effective utilization of the cluster resources and for administration of large UNIX clusters
Software engineering tools for developing high quality programs
Standards Adherence
C-DAC's HPCC software follows established standards to minimize learning time and maximize ease-of-use.
Most commands use familiar UNIX syntax.
HPCC software graphical user interfaces comply with Motif or Java style standards.
HPCC's implementation of the MPI standard closely follows the published standard and allows programmers to write portable parallel applications which run on the PARAM systems and other cluster systems supporting the standard.
