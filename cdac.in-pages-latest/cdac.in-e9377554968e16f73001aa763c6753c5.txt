MPI Program Environment
MPI (Message Passing Interface) is a standard specification for message passing libraries.
MPI makes it relatively easy to write portable parallel programs.
MPI does provide message-passing routines for exchanging all the information needed to allow a single MPI implementation to operate in a heterogeneous environment.
The MPI-2 has new areas for message-passing model such as parallel I/O, remote memory operations, and dynamic process management.
In addition, MPI-2 introduces a number of features designed to make all of MPI more robust and convenient to use, such as external interface specifications, C++ and fortran-90 bindings, support for threads, and mixed-language programming.
MPI 3.0 Standardization efforts and research work on hybrid programming (treating threads as MPI Processes, Dynamic thread levels) is going on.
The current multi- and future many-core processors require extended MPI facilities for dealing with threads.
The efforts on point-to-point and collective communications will be further tuned on multi-core and many-core processors.
MPI support two types of commonly used MPI programming Paradigms such as SPMD (Single Program Multiple Data) and MPMD (Multiple Program Multiple Data).
On Intel Xeon-Phi coprocessors, Intel MPI library with Intel Compiler environment is provided and MPI implementattions provide compiler wrappers (for example   mpicc  ,   mpiicc  , and  mpif90   ) to simplify the process of binding MPI programs and a utilities ush as   mpiexec.hydra   &   mpirun   to launch MPI program.
How to run Intel MPI on Xeon Phi
Access to necessary libraries :
Make sure all MPI libraries are accessible from the Xeon Phi card.
There are a couple of ways to do this:
Setup an NFS share between the Xeon host where the Intel MPI Library is installed, and the Xeon Phi corprossesor card.
Manually copy all Xeon Phi-specific MPI libraries to the card.
More details on which libraries to copy and where are available here.
1. Running natively on the Xeon Phi coprocessor (Coprocessor-only model )
Using MPI on Intel Xeon-Phi Coprocessors :   Intel Xeon-Phi coprocessor can be considered as a independent compute node and is capable of high performance networking via the coprocessor link (CCL).
Intel Xeon-Phi coprocessor is IP addressable and have own memory domain, also seperate from the host processors.
In this, MPI jobs are launched only on the coprocessors and it avoids the complex heterogenity of the symmetric case.
The native model where all MPI ranks are run on the Intel Xeon Phi coprocessor card.
To run natively on the Xeon Phi Coprocessor, given below important step are required.
(a).  Set up the environment,
(b).  Compile for the Xeon Phi coprocessor card
# for the Xeon Phi coprocessor
[hypack-01] $   mpiicc -mmic -o matrix_multiply.MIC mult.c
(c).  Copy the Xeon Phi executable to the cards (This step
is not required if your host and Xeon-Phi card are NFS-shared.),
(d)  Launch the application using  mpirun.
Following step is required for setting up the  I_MPI_MIC  environment variable.
export I_MPI_MIC = enable
and prepare the  mpi_hosts   file and in our examples write the following 8 host names indicating  node  and  mic  cards information.
ycn209-mic0
ycn209-mic0
ycn210-mic1
ycn210-mic1
ycn211-mic0
ycn211-mic1
ycn212-mic0
ycn212-mic1
To launch the application binary run, execute the following command
mpirun -f mpi_hosts -n 8 ./run
There are two ways to execute jobs on Xeon Phi : (1) is ssh to Phi and (2) Set approriate environment on the Phi.
mpiexec.hydra -f hostfile -perhost 60 -np 120 \
matrix_multiply.mic
2. Running symmetrically on both the Xeon host and the Xeon Phi coprocessor
Symmetric :  MPI program can be run on a mixture of hosts and coprocessors without source code modification.
The program execution is symmetric - the complete program, the main function, the computational kernel, and MPI, runs on both the host and the coprocessor.
The programming model is logically symmetric.
The main idea is to utilize both the Xeon hosts on your cluster, and the Xeon Phi coprocessor cards attached to them.
Most importantly, the host and coprocessor cores do not have equivalent performance profiles as well as the communication performance.
The symmetric model where MPI ranks are run on both the Xeon host and the Xeon Phi coprocessor card.
To run symmetrically on both the Xeon host and the Xeon Phi coprocessor, given below important step are required.
(a).  Set up the environment,
(b).  Compile for the Xeon Phi coprocessor card and for the Xeon host and generate two different sets of binaries.
# for the Xeon Phi coprocessor
[hypack-01] $   mpiicc -mmic -o matrix_multiply.MIC mult.c
# for the Xeon Host
[hypack-01] $   mpiicc -o matrix_multiply mult.c
(c).  Copy the Xeon Phi executable to the cards (This step
is not required if your host and Xeon-Phi card are NFS-shared.),
scp ./matrix_multiply.MIC \
ycn209-mic0:~/matrix_multiply
(d)  Launch the application using  mpirun.
export I_MPI_MIC = enable
ycn209
ycn209-mic0
ycn210   ycn210-mic0
ycn211   ycn211-mic0
ycn212   ycn212-mic1
To launch the application binary run, execute the following command
mpirun -f mpi_hosts -perhost 1 -n 2 ./matrix_multiply
More about How to run launch application using Offload
Offload : In a message passing cluster, the compute nodes are equipped with multiple coprocessors and each MPI process on each compute node can offload the computational kernel to the coprocessor.
In this case, MPI calls cannot be made in offload region.
The offload model where all MPI ranks are run on the main Xeon host, and the application utilizes Offload directives to run on the Intel Xeon Phi corpocessor card.
This is also called as MPI + Offload paradigm and all MPI communications occur between Xeon Hosts only.
Offload used to accelerate MPI ranks.
Programmers designates (OpenMP, pthreads, TBB, or CilkPlus) code sessions to run on Xeon Phi using offload directives.
Most importantly, calling MPI functions within an offload region is NOT allowed and No direct file system access needed on Xeon Phi.
To Compile and Run in MPI Offload mode, first step is compile the code with offload directives, which is same as with MPI-OpenMP hybrid applications.
The Intel13 Compiler is the default complier option for the offload build.
To compile the code with offload directives execute the following command
mpiifort -openmp matrix_multiply.f -o matrix_multiply.offload
To request explciit no offloading :
mpiifort -openmp -no-offload matrix_multiply.f -o \
matrix_multiply.offload
mpiicc -openmp -no-offload matrix_multiply.f -o \
matrix_multiply.offload
mpiicc -openmp -align array64byte -offload-option, mic, compiler, \
"-O3 -vec-report3" -o matrix_multiply.offload
To launch application execute the following command
mpirun -host ycn209 -n 1 ./matrix_multiply.offload
mpiiexec.hydra -f -perhost 1 -np 2 ./matrix_multiply.offload
Resource Availability on Xeon Coprocessor : To coordinate coprocessor resource usage among the MPI ranks is an important from performance point of view.
Three methods commonly useful are :
Only running one MPI rank per host, so there is no chance of multiple ranks offload to the same Phi coprocessor
Heterogeneous: Running multiple MPI ranks per host but arranging processors to allow only single rank offload to the same Phi.
Explicit Pinning: Setting the pinning on a per-process basis to allow control of where each thread is offloaded.
About Launching of Different MPI Jobs
Launch MPI Job Type-1 : The following statements describe launch of two MPI ranks on the host with each rank offloaing for OpenMP threads
export MIC_ENV_PREFIX = MIC
export MIC_OMP_NUM_THREADS = 4
mpirun -n 2 ./vectvect_add
Launch MPI Job Type-2 : The following statements describe launch of two MPI ranks on the host with each rank offloading its part of the computations to the coprocessor.
export MIC_KMP_AFFINITY = 4
Using MPI natively on the coprocessor

Launch MPI Job Type-4 : The following statements launches to ranks on the host (ycn216) and two ranks on the coporcessor (ycn215-mic0)
# export I_MPI_MIC = enable
mpirun -host yn215 -n 2 ./vectvect_add : -host ycn215 -mic0 n 2 ./vectvect_add
Launch MPI Job Type-5 : The following statements launch a job using a hostfile containing a mixture of Intel Xeon and Intel Xeon Phi nodes
#!/bin/sh

ARCH= uname -m
if [ $ARCH == 'x86_64' ] : then
#host
exec $(EXE) $ =
elif [ $ARCH == 'klpm']; then

Objective
Extract performance in G/flops for Matrix Matrix Multiply and analyze the performance on Intel Xeon system with Xeon Phi Coprocessor using Memory Map (mmap)
Description
Two input matrices are filled with real data and the input data is stored in the sub-directory data.
The input matrix A and input Matrix B are loaded into Memory using memory map calls and matrix-matrix Multiply is performed.
The Output matrix C is initailized to zero entries.
The output matrix is mapped to main memory using memory map call and unmap to obtain the resultant output matrix, after matrix matrix multiply computations are performed.
This example demonstrates the use of memory-map library calls.
the offload computation of matrix-matrix multiply using OpenMP is performed to obtain the maximum achievable performance.
In implementation, every thread will work its own row array section of input Matrix_A and multiply with each column of Matrix_B, resulting to give an output array of resulting matrix Matrix_C.
It is assumed that the size of the two input square matrices is divisible by number of threads.
The optimisation features on Intel Xeon-Phi are not explored.
