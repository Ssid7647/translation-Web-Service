C-DAC lines up three launches on 26th Foundation Day
The Indian Express
April 11, 2013
On its 26th Foundation Day Thursday, R&D major, Centre for Development of Advanced Computing (C-DAC), will launch three products.
These include T-Learning Suite, an interactive enabling technology for education on broadcast media, Bio-Chemistry Analyser, an automatic medical laboratory instrument for analysing blood samples, and EDGE, an indigenously developed network management and monitoring solution.
The products will officially be launched by Chief Minister Prithviraj Chavan.
"We will need to learn, adapt and adopt to be in sync with global trends in technology development.
This is a dynamic process and will eventually determine our road-map in the next phase of growth and diversification", said Rajat Moona, Director General, C-DAC.
T-Learning Suite is an enabling technology for educational television broadcasters to deliver engaging interactive educational services.
It will cater to the needs of producers and broadcasters of educational TV programmes.
It is designed to cater to the interactive needs on television with and without the availability of the return channel in the set-top box.
The uniqueness of the suite lies in its design for the Indian scenario, enabling localised content.
The solution includes efficient localisation tools for generation of learning services in local languages.
C-DAC has developed EDGE (Enterprise Wide Self-Managed Network Solution) — an indigenous developed network management and monitoring solution.
The software will detect any anomalous behaviour in the network and will respond much quicker to any other software and can be modified as per companies' policy, an official from C-DAC said.
EDGE can even be configured to take network management decisions in order to protect the network from attacks.
An automated Bio-Chemistry Analyser is a medical laboratory instrument designed to perform bio-chemistry tests on blood samples, with minimal human assistance.
The automatic Bio-Chemistry Analyser, developed by C-DAC is aimed to make the system more affordable to the healthcare sector.
The results will be available in 4-5 seconds, a C-DAC official said.
Prof N Balakrishnan, Associate Director, Indian Institute of Science, Bengaluru, and Dr Tessy Thomas, Project Director-Agni V, Advanced Systems Laboratory, DRDO will also be present.
