Development of Mobile Application Interface to Indian Language Translation System over SMS Service.
The use of mobile computing environment for real time systems is now a reality due to rapid growth of mobile and the increased processing power and features available at reasonable price.
At present the mobile computing can be achieved by devices like handheld computer, PDA, Smart phone or standard java enabled mobile phones, and the choice depends on the various factors like operating system, memory, processing speed, storage capacity, camera and of course the price for large scale deployment.
Due to increasing Globalization, movements of people across different places have increased a lot.
In many occasion people (Businessmen, Tourist, Foreigner who are familiar with English) came in contact with people who are familiar with only their mother tongue.
In those situation to communicate simple important information is a big problem.
The MAT of English to Indian languages in its present state can be of great help to solve this problem.
The MAT engine in various Indian languages will be linked with the system to provide single point multi language communication interface.
With the development of TTS (Text to Speech) for example (Bengali TTS developed at our center) in various Indian languages the communication efficiency can be increased further by playing the audio output of the Bengali text where local people are not even familiar with their script (can not read in mother tongue).
User is required to have a handset with SMS transmission capability only.
Since the output will be respective Indian language, so respective language support for the handset is preferred to view the output directly but it is not mandatory.
The localized translated output can be forwarded to other supporting handset for view.
m-Translator Mobile application is available in all leading mobile development platforms like J2ME, Android, iPhone and Windows.
A HTML5 version is also available.
