Programs on Tuning & Performance
Compiler optimisation techniques, Compiler Switches, Code restructuring techniques play an key-role to extract performance of an application program on multi-core Processors.
Understanding Programming Paradigms (MPI, OpenMP, Pthreads, Intel TBB, MPI), effective use of right Compiler Optimisation flags and obtaining correct results for given application is important.
Enhance performance and scalability on multiple core processors for given application with respect to increase in problem size require serious efforts.
The High Performance Computing (HPC) tool simplifies the multi-core development, which increases application runtime performance and enhances developer productivity.
It is important for developer to identify performance hotspots in serial and parallel applications including distributed MPI applications on Multi-core processor systems.
The tools such as highly optimized compilers and libraries, code-level and memory debuggers, Thread analyzer, Application Performance analyzer, and system-profiling tools help developer to take full advantage of multi-core architecture systems.
The commercial HPC tools, which are provided by  Intel Software tools †33.
,  AMD †55.
,  IBM †59.
POWER-6/POWER-7 AIX,  HP †60.
,  Sun Studio 12 †68.
,  PGI Compilers †69.
, open source tools  PAPI †70.
,  HPCToolkit †71.
,  Jumpshot †72.
and other HPC tools provide an optimized environment for the development of single, multi-threaded, and distributed MPI applications, leading to more robust scalable software.
Several Optmisation techniques are discussed in  hyPACK-2013  Hands-on.
Programming environment information on Cache overview, simple classical optimizations, loop optimisation techniques (loop unrolling), Memory reference optimisation, common Errors in threaded programming (Pthreads, OpenMP, Intel TBB), performance issues in threaded programming on multi-core processors are discussed and example programs are provided.
Also, the example programs to understand compiler optimisation techniques, and code re-structuring techniques for better memory access are included.
