Industrial Wireless Base Station (iWase)
Brief Description
The Industrial Wireless Base Station (iWase) is a panel mountable device which acquires and process sensor values from sensor nodes in wireless sensor network and relay the information to a central monitoring station.
The iWase houses a powerful ARM processor and collects the radio packets using a 2.4GHz radio transceiver and relay the information to a SCADA network using Ethernet interface or to a remote monitoring station using GSM/GPRS interface.
The iWase also embeds a GPS receiver to provide location and time information to the iWiSe nodes in the network.
The iWase acts as a gateway between the wireless sensor network and the external world.
