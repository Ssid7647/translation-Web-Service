In order to improve search result precision through semantic search, C-DAC has put its efforts in developing the Quester technology, a NLP based Information Retrieval System capable of retrieving information based on a combination of keyword and conceptual matching which uses domain defined Ontology.
It is a knowledge based Information Retrieval (IR) system with the following features:
NLP based Query Processing using
Syntactic Parsing
Semantic Roles using Semantic Representations
Semantic-net and Knowledge-net for establishing information relation
Anaphora Resolution/ Co-referencing to link the pertinent portions of discourse with references for meaning coherence.
Text Processing & Tagging based on
Syntactic Parsing
Semantic Role Labeling
Named Entity Recognition
Anaphora Resolution /Co-referencing
Retrieval of query results through NLP based Retrieval Engine
Ranking/Sorting of retrieved results according to semantic relevancy in accordance to query
Churning out sentential level or paragraph level retrieval of information
