Workshop on Embedded Linux Development
(emlinux-2016)
About the workshop
With the worldwide proliferation of Free and Open Source Software (FOSS), the IT industry is undergoing a paradigm shift from Proprietary culture to FOSS culture.
Linux as FOSS is rapidly gaining momentum within the IT industry and newer initiatives are being rolled out to quickly adapt and integrate with the Open Source Development wave.
The promise of Linux FOSS triggers several challenges that need to be addressed so that the development process will progress rapidly.
With the continuous development of the electronics industry, newer hardware platforms are rapidly entering the market.
Catering to these requirements is challenging and requires tools and systems that ease the development time and efforts.
The commonly encountered challenges that developers face while administering to the kernel development process include the
Lack of developer friendly tools for kernel development
Limited debugging support for the kernel images and drivers
Insufficient documentation about development within the kernel
Ignorance to the available levels of abstraction for kernel development
Limited Support for Embedded Linux Development for ARM Platform
To address the above mentioned challenges we developed an Eclipse based IDE acronymed as “LinK+” which supports Linux Kernel Programming for X86 & ARM platforms.
This is developed under the project Self Aware OS sponsored by Department of Electronics & Information Technology (DeitY), Ministry of Communications & IT, Govt. of India.
The focus of this 6 day workshop on Embedded Linux Development is to provide the practical skills and knowledge required to work with Linux in the embedded environment.
In this workshop you will also get complete hands-on experience on LinK+ IDE for Linux developers.
