Gist
The Text-to-Speech System developed by the GIST group caters at present to Hindi and offers three different Text to Speech synthesis systems, classified as per the needs of the Industry.
On the one hand a LIMITED DOMAIN TTS SYSTEM geared to the requirements of systems where the number of sentences to be spoken is limited.
A GENERIC TTS SYSTEM which is a hybrid model (diphones + recorded words) and which can be used as a web-service to be used for a large number of web-applications where there is a need for voice rendering.
Finally a TINY TTS SYSTEM based on the phoneme level provides a library of a tiny phoneme set which can be deployed on hand-held devices like mobiles, PDAs etc.
With few modified rules system can be adapted for other Indian Languages also.
TTS Architecture :
The TTS system has a sophisticated architecture with a robust NLP (Natural Language Processing) back-end and a high quality Natural Voice system at the front end.

The main features of GIST TTS which distinguishes it from all other existing systems are as under :

Naturalness of speech quality in all three systems.
A strong linguistic back-end driven by statistical analysis which can handle all inherent problems of TTS in Hindi such as Schwa deletion and Syllable identification.
Robustness of the Engine
Language independent routines both for the linguistic analysis as well as for the synthesis front-end enabling thereby the creation of TTS in other Indian languages
Formatted Numbers Conversion like Date, Time, Float, Currency, Ordinal, Expression etc. from the running text.

Low size Database (3mb, 6k-mono wav)
3. Input and Output
