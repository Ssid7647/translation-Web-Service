Enabling Soilless Cultivation
(Available for Transfer of Technology)
Hydroponics is a method of cultivation, where plants are grown in soilless media using water and nutrient mixture.
It kindles a hope for food production in non-agricultural lands as well as in urban areas.
In this system, water mixed with minerals and nutrients is exposed directly to the roots of the plant that can be supported by various media like coco-peat, perlite etc.
C-DAC, Mohali with support from MeitY, Govt. of India, has developed a Continuous Flow Automated Hydroponics System.
It is installed at Dr. YS Parmar University of Horticulture and Forestry, Nauni, Solan (HP).
It has been successfully tested for production of lettuce, strawberry, Broccoli and Cauliflower.
Hydroponics Advantages:
A water efficient method of cultivation
Optimal use and reuse of nutrients and minerals
Freedom from Soil born diseases/infections/weeds/pests
Faster growth rate of crop than traditional farming
Amiable to cultivation in areas with water shortage or lacking soil-cover
Suitable for farming on ships/floating gardens, roof top farming in urban areas
A precursor to vertical farming
Applications:
Farming in Smart Cities
Roof-top Farming
Farming on Ships
R&D on Plant’s breeds in Labs
R&D on Roots and their growth (access to roots are possible in hydroponics system)
Jalkrishi - The Automated Hydroponics System from C-DAC
The installed system is a closed loop control system with graphical interface & programmability.
It involves calculated flow of nutrients and water in a five layered mixing tank.
The solution is pumped into the gullies where plants are grown with suitable supporting cups.
The roots of the plants directly absorb water and minerals.
Overflowing solution is collected in recycle tank and is pumped back to mixing tank for reuse.
The temperature, pH and conductivity of the solution can be monitored simultaneously for control.
The automation enables easy graphical user interface based programmable timing control and other monitoring of system.
The system can be scaled as per requirement to add new features.
Features of C-DAC Hydroponics System:
Indigenously developed low cost automated hydroponics system
Continuous monitoring of solution temperature, pH and conductivity
SMS Alerts/Query, Alarm, report generation and data logging with graphical representation
User friendly touch screen based Graphical User Interface
GUI based Programmable control parameters
Crop based Management System
Use of five layered tanks for mixing and water
Remote monitoring using SMS
System Specifications:
EC: 0.55 to 500,000 µS/cm ±5
pH: 0 – 14 pH ±1
Temperature Monitoring
1 HP pumps for nutrient mix flow
Poly-house Dim.: 15 x 7 x 4 meters (L x W x H)
No. of Gullies installed: 16
