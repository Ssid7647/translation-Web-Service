Industrial Wireless Sensor Node (iWiSe)
Brief Description
The Industrial Wireless Sensor Node (iWiSe) is an ultra-low power wireless device capable of acquiring and processing signals from any industrial sensor and transmits the information wirelessly to a base station for monitoring and control.
The iWiSe collects data, in the form of analog and digital signals, from sensors in the industrial environment and relays it to the base station with an on-board 2.4GHz IEEE 802.15.4 low power RF transceiver.
The iWiSe is provided with an ingress protection of IP65 and operating temperature of --40℃ to +85℃, which facilitates operation in harsh outdoor environments.
