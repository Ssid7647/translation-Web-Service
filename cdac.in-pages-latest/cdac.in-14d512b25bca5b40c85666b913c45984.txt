Seminar to focus on cyber crimes, emerging threats in IT
The Hindu
July 23, 2018
Issues faced by women to figure prominently
Superintendent of Police SV Rajasekhar Babu on Friday said that a high-level seminar on cyber crimes and latest threats emerging in information technology would be organised in Chittoor in August, in coordination with the Central government project of Information Security Education and Awareness (ISEA) and the Centre for Development of Advanced Computing (CDAC).
Interacting with lead bankers here, the SP said that online frauds were growing at an alarming rate throwing new challenges before the police.
He observed that as and when a new technology is introduced into the public utility system, the criminals are ever armed to outwit the same, making the information vulnerable to theft and creating multiple issues to the public.
Mr. Rajasekhar Babu said that the scheduled seminar will involve experts in dealing with cyber crimes, intellectuals from all walks of life, university professors, teachers and students.
Speakers at the seminar will focus on the huge canvas of cyber crimes and the imminent need for constant evolving of new technologies to counter the mal-elements.
Apart from online frauds, the subjects will extensively cover threats faced by women with advancement in internet age.
The schedule will further impart advance training to select target groups in effective prevention and detection of cyber crimes.
