PARAMNet-3 packet routing switch: ANVAY
The modular, 48-port packet routing switch 'Anvay' is provides a near wire speed (10Gbps) packet routing capability with very low latencies.
Anvay switch is based on Spider Line Card and Backplane subsystems.
Each line card support up to eight ports, with each port working at 10Gbps, full duplex speeds.
A fully populated switch supports approximately 1 Terabits/second of aggregate system throughput.
The switch supports multi-level switching, allowing cascading of switches for supporting larger clusters.
