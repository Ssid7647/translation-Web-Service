SCILAB Toolbox
C-DAC, Kolkata has developed SCILAB toolboxes (Image Processing, Signal Processing, Pattern Recognition and Wavelets), an open source software which is compatible to BOSS/Linux/Windows operating system.
Different modules of SCILAB have been explored thoroughly and found that a number of algorithms are yet to be developed to make it versatile to the level of MATLAB, a software package, most frequently used by students, researchers and academicians in the domain of science and technology.
Some newly developed algorithms which are not there in MATLAB needs to be included in Scilab as those are really useful for researchers, teachers and students.
The proposed project is designed to enhance the usability of SCILAB V 5.3.3.
Algorithm developed : SIP stands for Scilab Image Processing toolbox.
SIP intends to do imaging tasks such as filtering, blurring, edge detection, thresholding, histogram manipulation, segmentation, mathematical morphology, color image processing, etc.
Scilab Pattern Recognition Toolbox is a toolbox developed for Scilab software, and is used in pattern recognition, machine learning and the related field.
It is developed for the purpose of education and research.
Scilab Wavelet Toolbox is designed to work with any Scilab Image Processing Toolbox like SIP for displaying 2-D results.
It is intended for education courses, signal processing research and specific interests.
