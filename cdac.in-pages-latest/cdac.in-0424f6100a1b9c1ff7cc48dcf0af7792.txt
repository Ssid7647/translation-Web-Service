About Health Informatics Practices in CDAC
Healthcare is one of the most important aspects of human life.
C-DAC's Sushrut, a Hospital Information System (HIS) has been developed with the objective of streamlining the treatment flow of a patient in the hospital, while allowing doctors and other staff to perform to their peak ability, in an optimized and efficient manner.
HIS developed by C-DAC is modular, thus ensuring sustained benefits through changes in technology, protecting and providing optimal returns from the investment.
It is modeled on a unique combination of a 'patient centric and medical staff centric' paradigm, beneficial to the recipients and the providers of healthcare.
HIS uses a network of computers to gather, process, and retrieve patient care and administrative information for all hospital activities to satisfy the functional requirement of the users.
It also helps as a decision support system for the hospital authorities for developing comprehensive health care policies.
Over the years this domain has evolved through various phases a glimpse of which can be seen below:

Walk Through
The objective of Hospital Information System (HIS) is to help users to handle the patient and multitude of other details.
The goal is to build an integrated system to achieve the functionality.
Various modules present in HIS to make system functional are
EHR Standards and Integration
The healthcare domain in its entirety consists of multiple terminologies, methods, and numerous records keeping systems.
Over time these medical systems have become more complex and sophisticated.
With the addition of medico-legal requirements it has become a necessity to ensure that systems communicate in a defined manner and are interoperable with each other.
Such requirements can only be met with the implementation of globally established medical standards defined by International / National organizations and ratified by standardization entities.
