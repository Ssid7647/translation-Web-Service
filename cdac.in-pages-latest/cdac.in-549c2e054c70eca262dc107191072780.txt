C-DAC's HR philosophy holds the employee, its 'Member' (of the C-DAC family), as being at the center stage of the organization.
C-DAC's achievements are clearly attributed to the strong human resource spread over its ten different locations across the country, and manifest itself in employee centric policies, a great learning platform, freedom to think, innovate, challenging areas to work and an informal work culture that is second to none.
C-DAC greatly values the contribution of its employees and keeps its human resource issues under constant review, drawing inputs in this regard both through internal climate surveys and the external environmental considerations.
The management at C-DAC is confident that with a sound combination of a good hierarchal and functionally flat structure, an effective inter personal communication system already in place, newer HR thrust areas currently on stream, the employee centric HR philosophy will get a further boost and reinforce a belief in the minds of IT professionals that C-DAC is truly a great a place to be in.
