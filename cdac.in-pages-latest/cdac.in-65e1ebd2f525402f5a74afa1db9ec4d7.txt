SCADA SIEM (Security Information and Event Management) Tool
SCADA SIEM Tool
Brief Description
Security Information and Event Management (SIEM) Tool identifies threats on the SCADA test bed by continuously monitoring all data generated by different SCADA devices at multiple levels.
SIEM Tool uses the white listed file profile of Reference Data Set (RDS) of NIST (National Software Reference Library) to find anomalous files.
The monitoring process generates baseline for every experimental activity and identifies all anomalous activities by comparing the same with a reference signature based activity log.
The SIEM dashboard presents the monitored activities, which helps to identify the anomalies at a specific level, thereby reducing response time and also improves the forensic investigation.
