Open Office package is a useful set of application software that enables users to complete their day-to-day tasks quickly and efficiently.
The Open Office package contains a set of applications for performing a number of tasks like wordprocessing, spread sheets, etc. It is platform independent i.e Open Office can work on Windows and Linux.
Also being an open source software, it is free software, unlike MS Office suite.
The BharateeyaOO suite mainly consists of a word processor application (Writer), a spreadsheet application (Calc), a presentation application (Impress), a drawing application (Draw).
These applications have interfaces similar to those of the MS Office applications and those who are familiar with the other office packages such as, MS Office, Star Office and Lotus Smart Suite would find it easy to work with the BharateeyaOO package.
The data generated is cross-compatible i.e. Existing MS Office data can be opened and changed using OO and vice versa.
BharateeyaOO is UNICODE compliant and requires Indian language enabled OS.
Indian Language input is possible using Open Type fonts (for languages supported in the OS) as well as True type fonts for others.
It is therefore a great cost saver for individual users as well as large organizations using Indian languages on their computers.
The BharateeyaOO suite is the customized version of Open Office, with all the menus, status bars, error messages, user prompts, etc. localized for Indian languages.
There is a Help menu in each of the BharateeyaOO applications, which contains help options in Indian languages that can be used to take help on the various tools and commands of the application.
System requirements include Win XP service Pack 2 or Linux Fedora Core 6 and above with UNICODE Language Support with 512 MB RAM and 20 GB HDD space
