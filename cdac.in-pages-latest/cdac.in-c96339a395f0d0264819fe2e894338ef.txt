PARAMNet-3
PARAMNet-3 is high performance clusters interconnect developed indigenously by CDAC.
With development of PARAMNet-3, CDAC has joined an elite group of system developers worldwide, capable of providing a critical high performance networking component for building supercomputing systems.
Main application of PARAMNet-3 is as a primary interconnect for PARAM Yuva and Yuva-2.
Other application areas identified for deployment of PARAMNet-3 are storage and database applications.
PARAMNet-3 is also an integral component of HPC solutions offered by C-DAC.
PARAMNet-3 consists of tightly integrated hardware and software components.
The hardware components consist of Network Interface Cards (NIC) based on CDAC's fourth generation communication co-processor "GEMINI", and modular 48-port Packet Routing Switch “ANVAY”.
The software component "KSHIPRA" is a lightweight protocol stack designed to exploit capabilities of hardware and to provide industry standard interfaces to the applications.
