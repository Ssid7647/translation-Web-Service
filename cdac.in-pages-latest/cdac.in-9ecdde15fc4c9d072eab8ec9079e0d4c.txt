Industrial Real time Expert System Shell (iRESS)
Brief Description
iRESS comprises Real Time Expert System Shell, Learning Engine & Failure Forecast Engine, and is an integrated software tool which can be used by system developers and domain experts to develop Knowledge-based systems.
This tool allows creation of Knowledge Base (Hybrid KB), by encoding an expert's knowledge as a set of rules and frames and does inference using built in backward or forward chaining Inference Engine.
The tool is designed to interface with external SCADA systems via plug-in modules like OPC DA 2.0 and OSI Soft PI interface.
Can be used for alarm diagnosis and failure prediction.
Applications developed with iRESS are used in problem-solving and decision-making in a particular domain.
Main uses and domain
Process Industries, Power Plant, Pulp & Paper, Sugar Industry, Water Treatment Plant, Food processing Industry, sewer network monitoring systems etc.
