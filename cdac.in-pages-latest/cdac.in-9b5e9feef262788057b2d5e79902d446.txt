The Centre for Development of Advanced Computing will set up three new tech solutions to handle the cybersecurity and supercomputing requirements of the country.
This will include a new cyber security facility along with two software solutions.
These new initiatives were announced at the C-DAC’s 34th foundation day.
The Centre for Development of Advanced Computing (C-DAC) has announced three new tech solutions that aim to handle the cybersecurity and supercomputing requirements in the country.
These three tech solutions consist of a new cyber security facility offered as a service to other enterprises, as well as two software solutions that will empower developers to adapt code for latest hardware.
Cyber Security Operation Centre (CSoC) is spread across 6000 sq.
ft. in Thiruvananthapuram.
It will have a centralized security monitoring system that will report all cybersecurity related instances and offer high-level threat detection for enterprises that opt for this service.
The other two tech solutions aim to streamline software development for High Performance Computing (HPC) in India.
This comprises Parallel Development Environment (ParaDE) and the Automatic Parallelizing Compiler (CAPC), which simplifies the task of writing programs for supercomputing.
ParaDE is an Integrated Development Environment (IDE), which aids in the creation of parallel apps for supercomputing.
Parallel apps are made primarily for supercomputing systems, which include several computer processors that can run at the same time.
Such apps are developed so that they can perform the same calculations but with diverse data sets and processors.
CPAC can be utilised to convert apps written in sequential programming code into parallel programming apps.
This augments the effectiveness of software and is best suited for system development and assembly level programs.
C-DAC also set up funds to develop an app-based system which will be called Mental Health and Normalcy Augmentation System (MANAS).
This will serve as a scalable and exhaustive national platform for the mental wellbeing of the citizens of India.
The government has said that the platform aims to reach out to people through digital initiatives.
However, the services offered through this platform are yet to be revealed.
