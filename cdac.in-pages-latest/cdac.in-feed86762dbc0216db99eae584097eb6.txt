Multilingual Computing & Heritage Computing
C-DAC has a number of solutions for translation of English to Hindi and other Indian languages like Assamese, Bangla, Malayalam, Nepali, Punjabi, Telugu and Urdu.
A number of solutions have been developed in this area including Mantra, AnglaBharati and MaTra.
C-DAC has also developed translation systems for cognate languages of Hindi, Urdu and Punjabi.
Some of these are developed as part of multi institution consortium projects.
These systems differ in their underlying approach to translation as well as in language pairs and domains supported.
Given the complexity of automated translation, mostly a machine aided approach is followed, in all the systems.
Translation systems are hosted on http://translation.tdil-dc.in.
A mobile based translation application is also available from http://mgov.gov.in
