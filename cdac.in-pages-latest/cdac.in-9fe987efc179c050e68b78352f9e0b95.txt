Indian Language Fonts, Corpora, Dictionaries and Tools
As per eGovernance standards of character encoding for Indian-languages, all government web applications should be in Unicode.
Standardization is one of the baselines to be followed in localization.
Standardization means to follow certain universally accepted standards so that the developers from any part of the globe could interact through the application.
The worldwide encoding standard “Unicode” provides code points to every alphabet of the world.
In order to achieve this objective, "Development of Unicode Converter" is being undertaken by C-DAC Mohali.
