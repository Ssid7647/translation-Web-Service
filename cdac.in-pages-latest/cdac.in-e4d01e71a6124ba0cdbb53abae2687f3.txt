Malware Nivarak
Malware Nivarak prevents the attacks targeted through applications and it is based on positive security model.
Applications are profiled and its normal behaviour is captured in a sandbox environment.
Behaviour model of application is constructed from application profile based on resource specific clustering approach with fine grained access details to file, process and registry.
This solution is developed as client-server model where behaviour models of applications are maintained at server and pushed into the client systems for enforcement.
Application profiling and enforcement modules of the solution are developed as generalized layers by intercepting operating system calls in kernel space through mini filter driver in Windows.
Behaviour model generation module is implemented as platform independent.
Currently solution supports behaviour models of Adobe Acrobat Reader, MS Excel, MS Word and MS Power point.
End user can profile and generate behaviour model of any other application, as profiling and enforcement modules are developed as generalized layers.
This solution protects from application exploits and implicit malicious activity.
