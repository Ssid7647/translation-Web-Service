Himalayan Glacier Inventory Mapping
Study Area:  Parts of Indus, Ganga and Brahmaputra basin
Project Highlights
Generation of Glacier Morphological Maps using multi-temporal IRS LISS III satellite images and ancillary data
Generation of Glacier inventory data sheet, which provides glacier-wise details mainly related to the glacier identification in terms of number and name, location, elevation, dimensions, orientation, etc.
Systematic observations and measurements on glacial features using glacier inventory maps/layers
Serves as an input to Himalayan Snow and Glacier Information System and Natural Resources Census Database
Study of Equilibrium Line Attitude of Snow for understanding Crevasse Pattern using Reflectance and Backscatter with Advanced Image Processing Techniques
Project Highlights
Snow line mapping from optical images
Snow mapping by Normalized Difference Snow Index method
Demarcation of shape of glaciers over the period of time based on hybrid classification of optical data and texture measure based classification of microwave data
Crevasse Mapping by texture based classification
