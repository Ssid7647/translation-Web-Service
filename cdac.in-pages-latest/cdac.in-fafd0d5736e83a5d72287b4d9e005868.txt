Project is in collaboration with educational and industrial partners from across the country
Pune-based Centre for Development of Advanced Computing (C-DAC) is involved in the development of three supercomputers that will be ready by 2018.
After close to two decades, the manufacturing of supercomputers will take place on a larger scale within the country, these will occur in collaboration with both educational and industrial partners.
Rajat Moona, director general, C-DAC, explained, “Supercomputers were primarily only assembled in the country.
The aim of the project is to revitalise the manufacturing of supercomputers in India, and the government's Make in India has enabled this.“
At present, a technical committee is identifying sites where the supercomputers will be set up based on the preparedness and suitability of institutes.
The project has been undertaken in three phases.
The government has sanctioned Rs 4,500 crore for a period of seven years for the National Supercomputing Mission.Around100 individuals across the nation's C-DACs, but largely from Pune, will be a part of the project.
Moona said, “We are working towards making these supercomputers energy-efficient, employing cooling techniques while working towards making it possible to function at higher temperatures.
The supercomputers will be at least 10 times faster than the previous systems.“
Ashish Kuvelkar, associate director, C-DAC Pune, said, “Building these supercomputers within the country will foster a culture of manufacturing, this will ensure that the systems that are developed have the highest value as experts will provide the inputs.“
