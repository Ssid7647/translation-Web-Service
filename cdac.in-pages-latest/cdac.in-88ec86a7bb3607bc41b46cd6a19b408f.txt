Joining hands in making Pune as one of the Smart Cities, the Pune Municipal Corporation (PMC) has signed a Memorandum of Understanding (MoU) with city-based Centre for Development of Advanced Computing (C-DAC) on Tuesday.
CDAC recently analysed the status of software, government schemes and other digital platforms being used by the civic body.
Once studied, C-DAC will submit a detailed report to the civic body where the latter suggests immediate improvements.
"C-DAC has been roped in as the Information and Communication Technology (ICT) Knowledge partner.
We will guide the PMC in upgrading their systems, which the officials shall earmark as high priority for upgradation, " Senior Technical Scientist Sagri Sharma told Sakal Times.
C-DAC had recently undertaken a week-long training programme for civic officials during which they studied the lacunae and other shortcomings faced by officials during performing their duties, particularly, in maintaining and retrieving records.
"About 10-12 departments will be initially seeing a revamp.
This also means that there will be a need for setting up a centre that will monitor the city’s functioning which will need a strong technical backup, " she added.
The PMC has extensive plans to showcase research as one of its strong points in its final proposal to be submitted to the Ministry of Urban Development in December this year.
