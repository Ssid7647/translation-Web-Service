AIM :
"Parallel Computing Architecture and Applications on Multi Core to Many Core Processing Systems" is a 5 day workshop jointly conducted by CCOE, IIT Bombay and CDAC Pune, for training faculty in the area of parallel computing.
The main aim of this workshop is to stimulate teaching of parallel computing courses in Indian universities and colleges.
The workshop provides a strong foundation to faculty so that they in turn can offer parallel computing courses at under-graduate and post graduate levels in their respective colleges/institutes.
The workshop covers various paradigms of parallel computing, such as shared memory programming, message passing, programming on coprocessors (Intel Xeon Phi) and accelerators (CUDA -NVIDIA).
Theory and practical sessions are conducted to write, execute and demonstrate numerical and non-numeric computations using different programming paradigms.
There will be several hands-on training sessions with accelerators, to give deep insights into their architecture and how-to-program for achieving optimal performances.
