Hadoop Graph Analysis | Image & video processing
Image and Video Processing Application
The amount of images and videos being uploaded to the internet is rapidly in-creasing, with Facebook users uploading over 2.5 billion new photos every month and 100 hours of video every minute however, applications that make use of this data are severely lacking.
Current computer vision applications use a small number of input images because of the difficulty is in acquiring computational resources and storage options for large amounts of data.The Hadoop Mapreduce platform provides a system for large and computationally intensive distributed processing , though use of Hadoops system is severely limited by the technical complexities of developing useful applications.Hadoop using an Adaboost-based face detection algorithm (OpenCV) in which the face detection algorithm works on one image at a time, and attempts to detect the existence of faces in the image.

Algorithm for Image Processing:
Algorithm for Image Processing:
Steps
Description
Convert images you want to process to hadoop sequence file
Read binary Image into Byte Array in map function
Convert Image in Byte array to IplImage (Image Object in Opencv)
Apply your classifier (training data) on this image
Draw rectangle on detected face
Bundle detected imges into single hadoop sequence file
Store the sequence file to HDFS.
Extract Detected Images from seuence file.
Example Programs on Image processing :
Example 3.1
Write a Hadoop Program to Convert images into Hadoop friendly sequence file
Example 3.2
Write a Hadoop program to convert sequence file image in Byte array to IplImage
Example 3.3
Write a Hadoop program to Convert Hadoop sequence file into original Images and store them in your local file system.
Example 3.1 :   Write a Hadoop Program to Convert images into Hadoop friendly sequence file
Objective
Description
This Program Convert images into Hadoop friendly sequence file containing key of type as image filename and value of typeas image data in HDFS.
Input:Folder containing Images Output:Image sequence file.

Example 3.2 :   Write a Hadoop program to convert sequence file image in Byte array to IplImage
Objective
Write a Hadoop program to convert sequence file image in Byte array to IplImage
Description
This will take sequence file as input and convert Image in Byte array to IplImage (Image Object in Opencv) then apply classifier (training data) on this image to draw rectangles on detected faces and Bundles detected imges into single hadoop sequence file that will store to HDFS.
Image sequence file
