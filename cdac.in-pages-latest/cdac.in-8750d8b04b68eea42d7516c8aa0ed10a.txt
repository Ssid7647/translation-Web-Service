The Manthan South Asia & Asia Pacific Award 2014
The Project "IT based Computer Aided Design (CAD) Centre for Creative Design & Development by Artisans/ Weavers of Tripura, Assam & Arunachal Pradesh" of C-DAC Kolkata has received the Manthan South Asia & Asia Pacific Runner-up Award at the 11th Manthan Award Summit held on December 04, 2014 at New Delhi.
Shri Goutam Kumar Saha has presented the project at the Manthan Award Summit.
The project on development & deployment of IT-based Design Tools for common weavers and artisans has been recognised by The Grand Jury as Runner-up for the year 2014.
>CDAC Kolkata had set-up three CAD Centres in Naharlagun (Arunachal Pradesh), Mushalpur (Assam) and Agartala (Tripura) to train Master Trainers (Weavers & Artisans) in using state-of-the art IT-based Tools & Techniques using simplest methodology for IT-based Design Development and Deployment for Carpet, Handloom and Handricraft products.
Recognising that designing software available in the market are too expensive and cannot be used by common weavers & artisans because they contain too many menus, sub-menus, tools etc. C-DAC Kolkata developed simple IT-based design tools that could be used without extensive knowledge of using computers.
It trained selected weavers/ artisans as master trainers in basic ICT-based design tools and use of PCs in their local vernacular language so that they could in turn teach other weavers/ artisans.
The project has so far trained 22 master trainers in Naharlagun (Arunachal Pradesh), 25 master trainers in Agartala (Tripura) and 25 master trainers in Mushalpur (Assam).
Theses beneficiaries (Master Trainers) are now imparting training to other weavers/ artisans in the respective clusters of the states.
