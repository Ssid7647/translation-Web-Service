SARANSHAK- the Semantic Multi-Document Summarizer
The group has also been working on Natural Language Processing based SARANSHAK- the Semantic Multi-Document Summarizer which is based on semantic gradation of pre-defined concepts or percentage of user-selected document (s) within user-defined parameters.
The Summarizer is configured to undertakeexhaustive ontology creation for semantic derivation of user defined concepts/lexicon and their semantic gradation.
Semantic-gradation of user provided concepts and topical data relevant to user domain.
It enables selecting document (s) at a given time and collating and summarizing their results.
Summary can be achieved either on given user defined concept (s) or selected percentage or even a combination of both concepts and percentage.
Summarizer can be plugged in with different other applications like NLP based Meta-Search engine, Cross-lingual Information Retrieval System etc.
