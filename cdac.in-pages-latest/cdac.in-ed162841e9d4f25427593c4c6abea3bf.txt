Patient Medical Records
Registration of the patient is the foremost activity in the overall Hospital Information System.
Every patient who approaches a hospital has to get registered prior to getting any consultation, treatment, and investigations done from the hospital.
Registration of patients involves accepting certain general and demographic information about the patient.
The patient is given a unique central registration number (CI No.). The Patient is also given a patient identification card, known as Registration Card.
Different categories of Registrations are:
Normal
Staff
Emergency
VIP/Senior Citizen
Normal registrations are done in the routine OPD timings.
Emergency Registration is done for the patients who require immediate medical attention.
The patients getting registered under this category are basically:
Out-patients whose unit is not working on that day
Medico-Legal Cases
Patients requiring immediate medical attention
Patients coming after the OPD hours also are registered as Emergency Patients.
Staff Registration takes care of the registrations related to all the staff members of the hospital.
Input/Screen Interfaces
