Integrated Web based GIS enabled System for Indian Urban Air Quality Management
UrbAirIndia
Key Features
It is an expert system that deals with various components of air quality management viz. air quality monitoring, emission inventory, dispersion and receptor modeling, and multiple scenario analysis.
The system combines air quality monitoring data of user defined campaigns/Projects, emission inventory, query mechanism for data analysis and future scenarios, dispersion and receptor modeling with plug-play facility using GIS platform.
UrbAirIndia has four major components,
Air Quality Monitoring: Receive and store air quality monitoring data.
Generate future scenarios for business as usual as well as with control options for various sources.
Emission Inventory: Receive and store activity data and emission factors for various sources.
Calculate emissions estimates and store emission inventory data.
Dispersion Modeling: Receive and store dispersion modeling output data with meteorological data.
Receive and store source profile data for particulate matter.
Receptor Modeling: Receive and store receptor modeling output data in the form of source contribution estimates.
It will provide useful inputs to policymakers for taking air quality management decisions, environmental researchers for analyzing scientific data, public as an information portal.
Establishing an automatic framework for strategies to reduce pollution.
Perform statistical analysis through queries and display results in the form of GIS maps, graphs and reports.
This system will have controlled access to CPCB, SPCB, researchers, general public, for analysis, data generation, and general viewing, etc.
