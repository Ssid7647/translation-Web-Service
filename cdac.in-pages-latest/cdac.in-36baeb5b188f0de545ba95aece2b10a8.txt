hyPACK-2013 : Mode-2 (ARM Coprocessor ) Laboratory : Topics
The  Mode-2  programme covers an overview of  ARM  microprocessor technology which address the performance, power and cost requirements for almost all applications.
ARM platforms with CUDA parallel programming toolkit, provides the foundation for developers to build out the ARM HPC application ecosystem.
The CARMA DevKit features the NVIDIA Tegra 3 Quad-core ARM A9 CPU and the NVIDIA Quadro 1000M GPU with 96 CUDA cores.
It offers HPC developers a simple way to create CUDA applications for GPU-accelerated systems with ARM processors.
The topics such as Tuning and Performance Issues, Power Consumption for Application Kernels, Measurement of Power Consumption - using External Power-Off-Meter, and Programming on ARM processor multi-core processor systems will be discussed.
Mode-2 Performance - ARM Multi-Core Processors
ARM Processors - An Overview of Architecture & programming environment
Software Multi-threading & System Overview of threading
Parallel Processing - An Overview of Programming (POSIX Threads, Intel TBB, OpenMP)
Tuning & Performance of Application kernels using NVIDIA carma DevKIt
Performance Issues of OpenMP 3.X & Pthread Programming on ARM Processors
Measure Power Consumption and Performance of Benchmarks using CUDA enabled NVIDIA GPUs - carma DevKit.
