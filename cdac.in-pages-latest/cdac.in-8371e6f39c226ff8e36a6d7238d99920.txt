System Features :
The Universal Speech Translation Advanced Research Consortium (http://www.ustar-consortium.com/) is an international research consortium conducting research and development on a network-based speech-to-speech translation (S2ST) system, with the aim of breaking the language barriers of the world.
U-STAR has developed a speech translation app using this network-based S2ST system, which help multiple users (up to 5) to communicate in different languages, in real time either face to face or remotely.
CDAC, Kolkata as a member is assigned the job to incorporate Bangla as a language in the USTAR S2S translation system.
The application contributes to overcome the barriers of languages as well as communication modalities.
For instance; it helps users to communicate with the visually-impaired via spoken word, or with the hearing-impaired via text input.
This application mainly targets the field of travel-related conversations at airports, hotels, shops, and restaurants.
The application covers a total of 31 Asian and World languages.
