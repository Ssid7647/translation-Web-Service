New e-learning software to be launched today

The Centre for Development of Advanced Computing (C-DAC) has developed a software that can provide courses in e-learning via television set-top boxes.
City-based C-DAC has tied up with Educational Media Research Centre for this project and officials said that a total of 80 courses will be available on set-top boxes soon.
The software will be launched in the presence of chief minister Prithviraj Chavan in Pune on its C-DAC's 26th foundation day on April 11.
Addressing a news conference on Wednesday, Mahesh Kulkarni, head of the language technology at C-DAC, said, "Most e-learning software programmes available now are one way.
However, the software we developed is interactive and the users can get themselves engaged in it through quizzes and other programmes."
The software will offer distance learning facility to citizens sitting at home through the medium of television on topics ranging from healthcare and commerce to governance and entertainment.
Also, C-DAC will be launching a tool mainly useful for pathology laboratories that do human blood sampling.
This technology, known as automatic bio-chemistry analyzer, performs tests on blood samples with minimal human assistance.
"Each sample takes maximum five seconds (to test) which leads to faster results.
Currently, these bio-chemistry analysers are imported in India, but the C-DAC bio-chemistry analyser will help reduce the cost of the test, " Rajat Moona, director general of C-DAC said.
C-DAC also released a software for network management mainly usable for local area network and wide area network.
This software will detect any unusual activity by computer users and in case of one, will take action against the user immediately.
Looking back at C-DAC's performance over the last 25 years, Moona said, "We have worked endlessly in areas such as language technology, e-governance, and various applications for the north-east region.
Our focus has now moved to wider range of topics that include e-governance, medical electronics, professional electronics among others.
We are also exploring new capabilities in high performance computing and the coming years will see more citizen friendly products from our stable."
The products will be launched by chief minister Prithviraj Chavan at the Inter University Centre for Astronomy and Astrophysics ( IUCAA) on Thursday at 6 pm.
