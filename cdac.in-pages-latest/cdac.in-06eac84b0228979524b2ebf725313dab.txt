No guesses for local forecast now

Anuman, a mobile app made by C-DAC, promises real-time hourly weather updates of a four-km radius area.
It's a step ahead of the sundry mobile weather applications flooding the market and will give you real-time forecasts.
At least that's what the Centre for Development of Advanced Computing (C-DAC) claims about its new baby.
"Anuman, the mobile app, has been developed by C-DAC Pune and offers the latest hourly weather updates on your mobile phone, covering over 50,000 locations all over India with high-resolution weather model output generated using C-DAC's national PARAM Supercomputer, " said Sahidul Islam, the senior technical officer with C-DAC.
Giving the presentation on the application, he said that unlike the other apps available in the market, this particular application will give real-time updates of a 4-km radius in a particular area as it supports Geo-Positioning, retrieving the latest weather updates of the user's current location.
Gufran Baig, the programme director of System of Air Quality Weather Forecasting and Research (SAFAR) and joint director of Indian Institute of Tropical Meteorology (IITM) sounded positive about the application, saying, "Its localised updates on weather would be more helpful for people.
However, it is important to know from where the weather forecasting data will be sourced as the information should be credible."
Apart from Anuman, C-DAC showcased four more applications, which are going to be launched at the centre on Saturday as part of its 28th Foundation Day celebrations.
The other products were named Works and Accountants Management Information System (WAMIS), ' Anuvidh', 'gotranslate' and ISM Basic.
Amit Deshmukh, another technical officer at C-DAC, showcased WAMIS, saying that this application will help various government agencies to apply for funds required for their projects.
Through this app, the government will also be able to track the progress of actual work and whether the funds are getting suitably utilised.
The other product, 'gotranslate', claims to help users translate various websites.
"The user just has to download a free plug-in, which can translate the website into 22 Indian languages, " said C-DAC director general Rajat Moona.
The Intelligent Script Manager (ISM), on the other hand, is a translator application that helps a user type in different Indian languages.
