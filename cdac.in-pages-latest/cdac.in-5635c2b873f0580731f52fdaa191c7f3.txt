C-DAC HPC Supercomputing Systems
C-DAC embarked on its first HPC mission in 1988.
Since then, it has delivered a series of supercomputing systems called PARAM series of supercomputers.
These include:
PARAM 8000, India's 1st Giga-scale supercomputer in 1990
PARAM 10000, 100 Gigaflop supercomputer in 1998
PARAM Padma, 1Teraflop supercomputer in 2002. This was India's first supercomputer to enter the Top500 list of supercomputers of the world (ranked 171 in June 2003)
PARAM Yuva, a 54 Teraflop supercomputer in 2008 (ranked 69 in November 2008)
PARAM Yuva II, a 529 Teraflop supercomputer in 2013 (ranked 69 in June 2013)
PARAM Biochrome is an HPC cluster for Bioinformatics applications.
The cluster has a compute capacity of 5 TeraFlops.
PARAM Bio Blaze: A supercomputing facility with peak compute power of 10.65 TF, was launched on February 18, 2014 to address the challenges in bioinformatics
PARAM Yuva II (File Type: .pdf, File Size: 2.48MB, Updated on: Jan 2013), the latest in the series, is a eight-core, dual-socket node based hybrid compute cluster with multiple interconnects, compute co-processor, hardware accelerator, high performance storage and supporting softwares for parallel computing.
It incorporates C-DAC's in-house technologies including PARAMNet-3 - a High Speed System Area Network, FPGA based hardware accelerators called Reconfigurable Computing System (RCS), a range of Systems and Applications Software components, and Industrial Design and Engineering of the whole system.
PARAM Yuva II has sustained performance of 386.71 TF for LINPACK Benchmark and peak performance of 529.4TF.
It has high bandwidth storage of 200 Terabytes.
