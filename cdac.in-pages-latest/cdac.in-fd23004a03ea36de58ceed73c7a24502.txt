C-DAC BharatiyaAFIS refers to a family of Software Development Kits (SDKs) & Systems: BharatiyaAFIS SuiteTM to offer a much improved accuracy and high-performance fingerprint identification for Government agencies.
The products are in full compliance with international standards, viz. ISO/IEC 19794-2:2005, ISO/IEC 19794-4:2005, ANSI INCITS 378-2004, ANSI/NIST-ITL 1-2007, ILO-SID.
The high precision is achieved with the help of fingerprint's Level III features (pores, ridge contours, edgeoscopic features: the intricate details of the friction ridges).
This project was initially funded by Department of Electronics and Information Technology, Ministry of Communications and Information Technology, Govt. of India.
The BharatiyaAFIS Suite comprises:
C-DAC BiometricSDK (General Purpose SDK)
C-DAC ILO-SID BiometricSDK (for Seafares Identity Documents)
C-DAC BharatiyaAFIS-II (AFIS based on Level I and II features)
C-DAC BharatiyaAFIS-III (AFIS based on Level I, II and III features)*
C-DAC Fingerprint Attendance System
C-DAC Standardized Template Converter
C-DAC Fingerprint Image Quality Assessment Tool
C-DAC Fingerprint Slap Segmentation Tool
C-DAC Fingerprint (Latent) Image Processing Toolset
C-DAC Automated Performance Evaluation Tool
As everywhere in the world, in India too, biometric-based security is being given the top priority for addressing the following serious concerns/issues/threats:
Multiple enrollments in electoral, welfare, driver licensing or similar systems.
Ill-legal immigrants, cross border terrorism.
Lack of background checks for job applicants for highly sensitive posts and educational personnel.
The emergence of biometrics technology in India has witnessed the engagement of a diverse set of global players, each with their own agenda and role.
Overall weak preparedness and privacy technologies at security prone areas such as air/sea ports, banks, offices, etc.
