Floating Point Unit IP Cores
Brief Description
Floating Point computation plays a significant role in a variety of scientific and engineering applications.
The FPU arithmetic core can be used in applications such as climate modelling, supernova simulations, electromagnetic scattering theory and Computational geometry and grid generation to image processing, FFT calculation, matrix arithmetic, Eigen Value calculation, Jacobi solver, etc.
Main uses and domain
Can be used as a hardware accelerator for high performance computing applications
Can be used an Instruction set enabled floating point co-processor
