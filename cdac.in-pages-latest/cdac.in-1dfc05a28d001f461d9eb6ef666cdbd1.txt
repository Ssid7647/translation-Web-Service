abcd-2014 Hands On Session
abcd-2014 Hands-on Sessions (HoS) will be conducted on Multi-Core processor Systems with GPUs and HPC GPU Cluster.
The Day-1 programme is designed to quickly adopt to MapReduce programmig on HPC Cluster.
Partcipants may use basic programming APIs or fundamentals of host-cpu programming such as Pthreads, OpenMP, Intel TBB & PVM, OpenMP, MapReduce framework.
The approach adopted to heterogeneous programming for Data Intensive application kernels and numerical linear algebra on hybrid computing systems (  HPC GPU Cluster) is discussed modules of (   abcd-2014 ) are given below.
