In a bid to raise standards of technical education, Centre for Development of Advanced Computing (C-DAC) Pune, has signed a Memorandum of Understanding (MoU) with PEC University of Technology, Chandigarh, to promote research and academics in advanced technology.
The MoU was signed by Dr Hemant Darbari, Executive Director, C-DAC, Pune, and Dr Manoj K Arora, Director, PEC University of Technology, Chandigarh, on behalf of their respective institutions.
Under this MoU, the focus will be on subjects like geoinformatics, disaster management, cyber security, super computing and software engineering.
Both the institutions will support each other’s endeavours in delivery of academic programmes and research activities through Ph.D and PG programmes for C-DAC employees, while C-DAC will make available full semester internship for the PEC undergraduate students.
In addition, the PEC postgraduate students will also be facilitated to undertake six months to one year project works at C-DAC.
The two institutions will also work together for joint project execution in areas of common interest.
Speaking on the occasion, Dr Darbari said, “C-DAC has always favoured the strengthening of industry-academic interactions on a long-term basis to raise the bar of technical research in the academic sector.
This collaboration will assist the students in assimilating the best of experience from our R&D labs, as well as guide them in taking up equally challenging subjects in their research pursuits.”
