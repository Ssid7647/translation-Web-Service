Decision Support System
Decision Support System (DSS) for District Administration
A district being the main entity within the state has to handle various activities like Education, Health, Transportation, Irrigation, and Power.
A Decision Support System was configured to manage formulation and flow of information within the District and from District to State level.
This activity required integration of data from various departments within the district, analysing the data and planning.
The GIS based Decision Support System developed by C-DAC provides the IT framework for information handling, leading to planning activities in respect of Education, Health, Roads, Irrigation, and Power etc.
The system has been successfully implemented across eight districts from Uttar Pradesh and Haryana.
It is intended to roll over further to another two districts from Himachal Pradesh.
Achievements:
This project was successfully implemented at 10 Districts with Appreciation Letters from all District Magistrates.
