Industrial Colour Sensor System (iCoSS)
Brief Description
iCoSS (industrial Colour Sensor System) is a handheld standalone unit that is capable of identifying and measuring different colours.
The system can be used for both reflective and refractive materials by attaching separate colour sensor modules.
The system gives RGB and CIE-L*a*b* output values along with corresponding three channel 4-20mA analog output.
PPM values for the residual chlorine determination is also given as output both in LCD display as well as 4-20 mA analog output.
Main uses and domain
Process Industries, Power Plant, Pulp & Paper, Sugar Industry, Water Treatment Plant, Food processing Industry, sewer network monitoring systems etc.
