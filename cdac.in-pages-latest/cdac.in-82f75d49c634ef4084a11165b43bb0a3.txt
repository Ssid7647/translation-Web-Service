November 30, 2016
C-DAC had organised a two day Indo-German workshop on HPC architectures and applications in collaboration with Forschungszentrum Julich, Germany, on November 29th and 30th, 2016.
This workshop was conceived by C-DAC with the background of C-DAC and Indian Institute of Science (IISc) being the implementing agencies for National Supercomputing Mission of Government of India.
The workshop was inaugurated by Dr. Vijay P. Bhatkar, eminent scientist and technocrat.
Dr. Jurgen Morhard, the German Consul General of the Federal Republic of Germany in Mumbai was present as the Guest of Honour.
Prof. Rajat Moona, Director General, C-DAC welcomed the guest.
Prof. Dirk Pleter from Forschungszentrum Julich gave an overview of the workshop.
In his address, Dr. Jurgen Morhard mentioned that India and Germany are already having a large number of collaborations in automobiles and Industrial automation.
India has a leadership in IT.
He felt he sees a great potential in collaboration between Indian and German Scientist.
A large number of Indian population uses mobile phones and one can see how quickly Indian citizens are adopting newer technologies like mobile wallets etc. The German government, he said, recognises the potential of collaboration with India.
The Consul General wished the workshop to become successful such that it leads to many joint activities
Dr. Bhatkar recalled his association with German companies in the field of automation and his collaboration with University of Bremen, in early part of his career.
He mentioned that relationship between cultures of two countries is very deep.
He cited the example of Max Muller who had translated ancient Indian scriptures from Sanskrit to German.
He mentioned that when C-DAC initiated building PARAM supercomputer in late the late 1980s, Germany had launched a project called Suprenam.
He stressed that rather competing with each other, time has come for countries to collaborate with each other.
This will help in addressing the challenges like global warming, that the humanity is facing worldwide.
He said that India and Germany should establish collaboration by building on their respective strengths in Information technology, which is the need of the hour.
He wished the workshop a great success.
Dr. Hemant Darbari, Executive Director, C-DAC, Pune proposed a vote of thanks.
There were 8 sessions each with a talk by an Indian speaker and a German speaker, covering various aspects of High Performance Computing (HPC) architectures and applications which included,
Accelerated HPC architectures and technologies
HPC Applications in Earth sciences
HPC programming models and performance tools
Virtual reality and visualization
Scalable Mathematical Models and Algorithms
HPC Applications in Turbulence
Education in HPC
The last session saw a Panel discussion on future HPC roadmaps and challenges
Participants from various R&D institutes from India and Germany engaged in HPC, attended the workshop.
The workshop provided the participants a chance to understand the latest global trends in various aspects of HPC.
The workshop also served as a platform for Indian and German researchers to engage in collaborative projects.
