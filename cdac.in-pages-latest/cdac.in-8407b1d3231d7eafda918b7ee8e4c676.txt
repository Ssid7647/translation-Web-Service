Workshop on Analog VLSI Design on 22-23 January, 2016 at C-DAC, Bangalore
Workshop Overview
Centre for Development of Advanced Computing (C-DAC), Bangalore is organizing two days workshop on Analog VLSI Design on 22-23 January, 2016.
The two days workshop deals with the design of various building blocks for Analog VLSI.
The following topics will be covered in the workshop.
Analog fundamentals-CMOS-OPAMP-OTA fundamentals
Fundamentals of filter design
Design methodologies such as Active RC filters, OTA-C filters, Current-mode filters, Switched capacitor filters
Effect of non-ideal passive and active components such as tolerances of components
Finite gain, bandwidth of active devices, noise of passive and active devices, offset of active devices, parasitics due to interconnections as well as inherent parasitic
Design choices for low power supply voltage designs
Recent trends in filter design for various mobile devices using GSM, CDMA.W-CDMA, Bluetooth technologies etc.
Design of other analog building blocks such as current sources, voltage references, A/D converters, D/A converters and especially Sigma-delta converters of both discrete-time and continuous time types
PLL Design, Basics of RF CMOS design, Analog layout, Analog Fault diagnosis, SPICE analysis of various circuits
